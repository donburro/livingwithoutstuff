        <p>
            Think about what you said you wanted back in

            As you re-read what you wrote, write out how it makes you feel.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Nothing special, just write down whatever feeling-words come to mind first. 
        </p>
        
        
        <p>
            That's it.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            You have recorded history. Read it often so you can have those same feelings often - calendar notifications are great for this.

            Now that you have the budget, the most important peice of machinery, up and running, it is a good time to imagine you have already reached your target number. Start thinking about what you're going to do and how you are going to handle it.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            It's useful to do this now because it'll allow you to do the thing you want to do more effectively. 
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">
            If you have a day job like me, you're going to need to think about how to manage that to your advantage. I'm going to be taking 3 months off from work, which is much more than the allotted vacation time. People at work are going to look at me funny and think I'm looking for another job. They may not even let me do it.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            There are many different ways you can do this, from just not showing up one day to formally quitting. I don't think suddenly not showing up is the best option. Formally quitting can work out really well, depending on how you do it. I'm planning on talking to my manager as soon as I hit my number, or even earlier to plan things out. That's going to require a type of conversation that I have not yet had with my current manager. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            If you're in the same boat, start thinking about the conversation you will have with your <strike>boss</strike> biggest client, and the others that work alongside you. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Start thinking about the conversations that you will have with your parents. My dad is very traditional, and he did not like many things about what I was doing, especially leaving on job without having an offer in hand for another. I need to plan out how I'm going to phrase it so that it doesn't cause a bunch of drama there like last time. My mom will love it, so that's easy.

            Start thinking about your employer as your client. This will create a framework in your mind that will make it easier to have those daunting conversations.
        </p>
        
        <p> 
            <em>How is my employer my client? </em>

        <p class="indent-1">
            You sell your time to your employer in exchange for money. What if you're not paid hourly? Then it's just how much salary you make per year, which is still a measure of time.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            When you take a step back from the daily grind, you'll quickly realize that your time is the most inefficient thing you can trade for money.

            I'm going to be writing some posts that will help you to shift the way you think about work. You'll be able to find them on the <a href="../index.html">home page</a>.
