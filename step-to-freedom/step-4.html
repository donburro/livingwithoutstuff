            By now, you should have a list of places and things your money goes towards - a budget.
        </p>
        
        <p class="">
            That's great, but now what?
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Well, the purpose of creating the budget in the first place is so that we can have an input to the equation of how many points we will need to stash for day-to-day living.
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">
            For me, because I'm planning to take an unpaid leave of absence for three months, I need to figure out how much I spend each month. Once I know this number, I can multiply by three, add in any other things I'll need to get, and then set this as my target amount for Goal 2.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            So, you might be wondering where the best place to keep your budget is. We'll talk about that and some other commonly pressing budgeting questions in this post.
        </p>
    
    
        <h2>Where should you keep your budget?</h2>

        <p>
            The short answer: whatever works for you.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Yea, I know that's a shitty answer, but it's the best one I can give. There are <em>plenty</em> of budgeting tools out there that one is bound to suit your needs: Quicken, Mint, YNAB, Excel, Word, peice of paper... 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Just pick one of them.
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">
            But which one do you pick? Which one is the best?
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I have a few humble suggestions for you before you start:</p>
        
        <ul class="texty-list">
            <li>
                <strong>Don't push a square wheel</strong><br />
                Just like me, you might have a tendency to want to create and use your own things. When I first decided to start budgeting, I created an Excel spreadsheet using VBA to enter transactions and run daily, monthly, and time-bound reports.

                    This was the worst budgeting software I've ever used. The product specifications were:

                            Expense_Tracker.xlsx allows you to consolidate all of your transaction data into one centralized location so you can can track how many points you need to in order to take three months off work.

                Jesus. What was I thinking? Looking back at it now, I can't even fathom that I recorded my expenses like that for more than a week. One of the things I <em>absolutely hate</em> doing is saving receipts from my purchases. Why would I ever need to prove to someone I bought groceries? They're going to be gone soon! Throw that shit away.

                <strong>Free isn't always the best</strong><br />
                If you're not already convinced that trying to do this with your own version of <em>Expense_Tracker.xlsx</em> is a horrible idea, I'm not much such what else to tell you.
                
                <p>
                    But, there are several free softwares out there that attempt to throw some automation (sometimes too much) in the mix to make your life easier. Heck, some even allow you to pay all of your bills in one place with a bill-pay service and view your credit score. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    So you have a lot of options. There are a lot of options out there. I use and have used several. One of the most common ones that comes up is Mint.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    I have had a Mint account ever since college, but never really properly got into the workflow of using it. Recently I tried to bring it back to life to do a side-by-side comparison of it with YNAB, thinking that I might save a few bucks and switch if it works just the same. I will post my comparison in a future post.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Needless to say, I didn't switch. In my case, free wasn't best because (1) I had already been using YNAB for a while, (2) knew how to use it, (3) didn't want to have to re-architect an already working solution to get the same end result.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    That third point is important. Think about it. If two products do the same thing, what's the difference which one you use? At the end of the day, you're going to be using your budget to obtain <strong>a single number</strong>. If it can do that in a way that you are happy with, great! That's all you need.
                </p>
                
                <p class="indent-1">
                   For you, it may even be <em>Expense_Tracker.xlsx</em>! But in this day and age, I highly doubt that.

                    If you do extensive research on each of your options to try to find the best one, you'll never get to <em>actually start</em> using one. Just sayin. And once you do, you might get a bit frustrated with one aspect of it, and then start over with another one.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    A good way to kick yourself is the butt is to sign up for a paid one that has a free trial.

                    I'm guessing most will let you try their stuff out for at least one month because that's how long it takes to get any results you can start working with.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    If, at the end of the trial period, you just can't stand using it because it's so shitty, then cancel and try something else. Don't feel bad to tell someone you didn't like their product.
                </p>
                
                <p> 
                    If it works for you, keep using it. And know that the points you traded for it have already come back.

                <p>

                    I certainly wish that someone would have laid out exatly what I needed to to at the beginning of 2016 when I did this for the first time. It would have saved me so much time and frustration. I never would have convinced myself that 
                    <em>Expense_Tracker.xlsx</em>

            This is the part where I'll talk about my budget. Feel free to skip head to the questions at the very bottom.
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">
            It will be reflective. I'm not going to give any more budget-picking advice. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I told you earlier that I was excited about my new budget categories, that I'm now using the budget for things just beyond expense tracking. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Before go there though, let me show you what I've been doing and some of the problems I've found with it. I'll show you the categories I've been using for the past two years to explain my reasoning for my new categories.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            As you look through the categories, you'll see that some are 
            <em>very</em>
            specific. There is no need for things to be so specific. I even made some categories so specific that 
            <em>I didn't even use it.</em>
            That's 
            <strong>way</strong>
            too specific.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            A car is an entire group of categories itself. There are a bunch of under-the-hood costs of owning a car that a budget will force you to see. 
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">
            Your budget will force you to see a lot of things, whether you want to see them or not. A good budget is the opposite of a facebook feed. Even two years into budgeting, you will gain insights into what the hell you were thinking when you thought you had it all figured out.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            You'll notice that I don't have the rent expense. For the time I've been budgeting, I've been living at home. Looking back, moving back home for a time was probably the best decision I made, for reasons other than the economic.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            It's interesting to see that the yearly totals are so different for some categories, and nearly the same for others. Groceries increased by more than the amount that dining out decreased. What sense does that make? Misc transport, going out, entertainment, and relaxing are similar, which make them good candidates to add a spin to. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Ok, here come the dumber categories. Here we have the ones that are too specific. I didn't even buy any vitamins or honey or computer. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I also broke up most of my subscriptions into the specific thing of what they are. That had to go. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Cashback was included as its own category. There were expenses incurred in getting the cashback, so I used the budget to track the amount of net cashback I was getting. Since it lowers the total below 
            <em>true</em>
            spending, and because I'm not likely to keep up the work that is needed to get the $300-400 yearly cashback, it should be in a non-tracked category.

            I don't there will ever be another year where I spend below what I spent in 2017. Consider it the best year on record.

            Here are my new budget categories:

            These might seem like very subjective categories. What is a 'Good times > With friends'? What about 'Good times > Ehh wasn't that great'? What's that?
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">
            Those are good questions. I'll get back to you with the answer after a few months.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I wanted to make my new budget more meaningful beyond simply keeping track of numbers. In my last budget, I created a bunch of categories I  
            <em>never</em> 
            even used. Having more categories doesn't necessarily make it better.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            In accordance with the goal of simplification, I also thought about ways to reduce the total number of categories. 
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">
            One idea was to categorize things by the 
            <em>feeling</em>
            they produced instead of what it was. You could call this a <em>derivative</em> category. For example, 'Dining out' can be put into one of the categories under 'Good times'. 
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-2">
            What is a 'Good times' you ask? I don't know, you tell me! If you go out to eat with a group of friends, is that a good time? If it wasn't you can put it under 'Ehh wasn't that great'. 
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-3">
            The budget records more than just numbers now.

            I'm also not going to be using the budgeting feature. I'm not trying to predict how much I'll spend. I'm trying to measure it so I can input the value into Goal 2 calculation.

            Guys, I swear, this is just like a really long math problem. If you do good on it, you get an A in life.

            There are a few things that I am really excited with about this budget.

                    <strong>The 'Sleep late' category</strong> <br />
                    I have a category for going to sleep late? What does that mean? Well, If I go to sleep too late that I get out of bed in response to my alarm going off, I pay for that priviledge. Hmm, when I describe it that way, it sould kind of like a sacrifice to the alarm clock god. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    So, what's gonna happen? 
                </p>

                <p class="indent-1">
                    Well, one of the things that I know I need is enough sleep. I consider enough if I can go to bed, get up and feel well-rested, without 
                    <em>having</em>
                    to get up for something (like your alarm). If I
                    <em>have</em>
                    to get up in response to my alarm, I'm more likely to be in robot mode because I'll 
                    <em>have</em>
                    to do a bunch of stuff. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Where does the money go?

                <p class="indent-1">
                    Somewhere.

                    And I 
                    <em>have</em>
                    to make it go somewhere the next day.

                   Whoa, it's almost like resolving the curse of <em>have to</em>.

                <p class="indent-1">
                    I've stayed up late already two times on the new budget. The first ten went to a guy standing outside the train station asking for money. He bought a train ticket with the money.

                <p class="indent-1">
                    The second time, it went into the mailbox. I suppose that will be my last resort.

                <p class="indent-1">
                    I'm probably going to be paying for tonight too...
                </p>

                <p>
                    I am building the habit of going to sleep earlier and waking up without an alarm. This category is my attempt at doing this.
                </p>
                
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>
                    <strong>'Ehh wasn't that great' and 'Hmm not that important'</strong> <br />
                    Sometimes, the things that I choose to do aren't really that fun. I want to get better at figuring out whether I want to  do a certain thing. This one will force me ask myself if I would want to do the thing I just did again. If not, they go into this category.
                </p>
                
                <p> 
                    Goes for thing I buy too, but I'm not sure how well. If I buy an item, most likely I will be classifying it before I even get it, or right after I use it, so it would by default be an important item in my mind.

        <h2>Questions</h2>
        
        <p class="question">
            <em>
                How do you categorize between housing things like furniture, a blender, a toaster, paper towels, paper plates?
            </em>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Well, what do you use them for? These items are useful, so there should be a category for them.
        </p>
        
        <p >
            I would do this:
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">
            furniture &rarr; Household items <br />
            blender, toaster &rarr; Food <br />
            paper towers, paper plates &rarr; Good times
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The blender and toaster category go into 'Food' because they help in the preparation of food, a thing necessary for survival. It makes sense to me then that any items that help in the preparation of food can appropriately go under 'Food'.
        </p>
        
        <p class="question">
            Should I have a category called Verizon? I realize that I might swithch phone plans later and change the category name, and then it would be difficult to compare to AT&T. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Absolutely right. A phone plan is something that I 
            <em>subscribe</em>
            to, so for me it goes under 'subscriptions'.
        </p>
        
        <p class="question">
            What about categories that you don't regularly use? Like furniture, new computer - do you just create them when you need them?
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Those are big purchases that don't happen very often, but they do happen. Part of why the budget is useful is because it helps you capture several points in time so you can easily find average values. If you create a category for 'Laptop' and only have one purchase in it, is that a good category? I think it can be, because averaged out over the other periods for which there were laptop purchases, you get a monthly average.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I would put a new computer in 'Important > Purchases'.
        </p>
        
        <p class="question">
            What do you do with reimbursable expenses?
        </p>
        
        <p>
            They go into 'Do Not Track' along with cashback. If you use your own card for work-related expenses, they'll show up in your budget. You can hide categories that you don't want to see in calculations or reports. Reimbursable work do not add value to a personal budget.
