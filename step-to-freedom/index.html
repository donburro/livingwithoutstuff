Future posts/topics to cover:
- What bank to use as staging? Which accounts?
- How should you load your 401k? (your biggest return generator is yourself)
- how do you categorize btwn housing things like furniture, a blender, a toaster, paper towels, paper plates?
- hmm, not super sure how to categorize some things. At first i was like - 'Oh! i should have a category called T-mobile.' But then i realized later on I might switch phone plans so then I would have to change the category name, and then it would be difficult to compare to 'T-mobile'.
- do you have categories that you don't regularly use or you just create them when you need them? i.e. furniture, new computer
