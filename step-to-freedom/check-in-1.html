        By now, you should have defined precisely what it is that you want, figured out roughly how much money you need to make that happen, and come up with budget categories.
    </p>
    
    <p class="indent-1">
        If you haven't completed those steps yet
        <a href="./">go back</a>
        and do them before moving on to the next step. This will be here when you are ready to continue.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Next, we are going to make our budget, figure out how much we need every month, and set up a system that will guarantee success.
    </p>
    
    <p class="indent-1">
        I don't use the word <em>guarantee</em> lightly here. If you set up your system right, you will get there. If the system fails, it's a shitty system.
    </p>
    
    <p class="indent-1">
        But we're not going to set up a shitty system. We're going to set up a system that will get you to where you need to be in order to get the things that you defined in the first step.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The only way you can fail is if you get to the finish line and <em>don't take the next step.</em>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        You can set everything perfectly set up, have everything ready to go, then get cold feet <em>do nothing</em>. It might happen. When I went through this two years ago, I had several bouts of doubt.
    </p>
    
    <p class="indent-1">
        <em>Is this really what I want? Should I really go through with this?</em> <br /><br />
        <em>I could just continue what I'm doing. My job is pretty comfortable, I'm well liked, and I think I'll get promoted pretty soon.</em>
        <em>Going off into the unknown is scary, and many people have told me that I'm not making a smart decision...</em>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The third point was a big one. It was probably the biggest threat to my following through, which, strangely, became the biggest motivator. It's one that we'll talk extensively about after we've set up our system. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Research shows that the more specifically you define what you want, the more realistic it is, the more you want it, and the more likely you it is that you won't get cold feet when the time comes.
    </p>
    
    <p class="indent-1">
        That's why it's so important that you have completed the first steps. Seriously - if you haven't done them yet, 
        <a href="./">go back</a>
        and do them.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Think for a second about what you defined in the first step. If you had everything you needed <em>right now</em>, what would you do? 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Would you follow through?
    </p>
    
    <p class="indent-1">
        If you said something like <em>"Yes, but..."</em> - GREAT! You're on the right track. Whatever came after the "but" doesn't matter. The most important thing you can do right now is start. Once you gain momentum, it'll be a lot harder for anything that comes up to stop you.

        In step zero, I basically said that I had to reset myself back to where I was two years ago in order to write about this in an effective manner. Part of that was to get my accounts back as close to zero as I could.

        Here are the results of that:
