            Now that you know what you want, figure out how much money you need. For this, you need to know advanced calculus.

            Just kidding, you just need to know addition.

        <p>
            The method for calculating how much money you need differs with the goal. I'll break down my goals as an example.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Here they are from the last post:
        </p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Get my own apartment, store 12 months rent</li>
            <li>Take a gap year</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Goal #1</h3>
        <p>
            How much do I need to pay for a year's worth  of rent in my area?
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Well, let's figure that out.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            If I search for the average rent in San Francisco on Google, the first result that comes up is from Curbed.com. They say this:
        </p>
        
        <div class="caption">
            <img src="images/stupid-rent-prices.png"/>
            Time to go be a landlord?
        </div>
        
        <p>
            That's what they have found to be the new normal price for a one-bedroom apartment in the city.
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">
           Seems a bit high for a place that I'm probably going to spend very little time in. I just need a place that's comfortable for sleeping, cooking, relaxing, and working. It doesn't have to be the nicest place.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Let's keep looking.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The link that goes to Rentcafe has a table that lists the average rents by apartment type:
        </p>
        
        <div class="caption">
            <img src="images/less-stupid-rent-prices.png"/>
            That's better. Still time to go be a landlord
        </div>    
        
        <p id="one-bedroom-studio-goback">
            That's headed in the right direction. The average studio is $1k less than the average one bedroom. They're basically the same thing though, so I'm a bit confused how one is priced so much less.
            <a href="#one-bedroom-studio"><sup>2</sup></a>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Another thing is that I'll be sharing the room with my girlfriend, so the rent will be cut in half. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Ok, well I still think it's a bit high, but for now I'd say I'm comfortable setting my rent ceiling at $1200.
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">
            12 times that is $14400. 
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-2">
            Adding in the security deposit, which in San Francisco can be as much as twice the rent, we have $16800. I'll round this up for good measure.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <strong>Goal one target amount: $17000</strong>
        </p>
        
        <h3>Goal #2</h3>
        <p>
            I need to fund my living expenses for twelve months. So the amount for the second goal is simply 12 times my monthly expenses.
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">
             
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1" id="footnote-trick-top">
            Well, I don't know what that is yet.
            <sup><a href="#footnote-trick">3</a></sup>
            There are also things that I'll have to ballpark that I don't have right now, like a gym membership and maybe a personal trainer. After a few cycles, I'll be able to determine this number, so I'll update the target amount for this goal later.
        </p>
        
        <h2>What you should do for this step</h2>
        
        <p>
            Calculate how much you need to do the thing that you want to do. Rough estimates are fine. What you should end up with is a number. 
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">
            That's it.
        </p>

                1. Well, isn't all math simply addition, multipilcation, and subtraction at its core? Further, subtraction is just the addition of a negative, and multiplication a shorter way of writing addition. (<a href="#footnote-math-goback">go back</a>)

                3. Well, I know what that is today. But, we're doing this from scratch, remember? So I'll be starting a new budget and figuring out what my spending is all over again.
