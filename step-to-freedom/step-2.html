        <h2>Very nice, how much?</h2>

        <p>
            Now that you've defined precisely what you want, it's time to figure out how much you need. For this, you need to know advanced calculus.
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1" id="footnote-math-goback">
            Just kidding, you just need to know addition.

        </p>
        
        <p>
            We'll walk through this example by me figuring out how much I need to accomplish my goals.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Here they are from the last post:
        </p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Move out of my parent's place and into an apartment I can call my own and prepay six months of rent.</li>
            <li>Take three months off work to work out.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>
            Starting with #1: How much do I need to prepay for six month's worth of rent in San Francisco?
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Well, let's figure that out.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Ok, well, if I search for the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=average+rent+in+san+francisco">average rent in San Francisco</a>, the first result that comes up is from Curbed.com. They say this:
        </p>
        
        <div class="caption">
            <img src="images/stupid-rent-prices.png"/>
            Time to go be a landlord, shit
        </div>
        
        <p>
            That's what they have found to be the new normal price for a one-bedroom apartment in the city.
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">
            What the fuck? Who in their right mind pays over $40k per year for a bed and a place to shit? If you're going to live and work in San Francisco where the average shitty tech job keeps you at work 60+ hours a week and hungover from the Friday happy hour, that leaves quite a small amount of time for your to enjoy the place that's eating up over 40% of your salary. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Anyway, that's not going to work for me. Let's keep looking.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The link that goes to Rentcafe has a table that lists the average rents by apartment type:
        </p>
        
        <div class="caption">
            <img src="images/less-stupid-rent-prices.png"/>
            That's better. Still time to go be a landlord
        </div>    
        
        <p id="one-bedroom-studio-goback">
            That's headed in the right direction. The average studio is $1k less than the average one bedroom. They're basically the same thing though, so I'm a bit confused how one is priced so much less.
            <a href="#one-bedroom-studio"><sup>2</sup></a>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Another thing is that I'll be sharing the room with my girlfriend, so the rent will be cut in half. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Ok, well I still think it's a bit high, but for now I'd say I'm comfortable setting my rent ceiling at $1200.
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">
            Six times that is $7200. 
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-2">
            Adding in the security deposit, which in San Francisco can be as much as twice the rent, we have $9600. I'll round this up for good measure.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <strong>Goal one target amount: $10000</strong>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            On to #2. I need to fund my living expenses for three months. So the amount for the second goal is simply three times my monthly expenses.
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">
            Well, I know what that is today. But, since I'm doing this from scratch, I'll be starting a new budget. There are also things that I'll have to ballpark that I don't have right now, like a gym membership and maybe a personal trainer. After a few cycles, I'll be able to determine this number, so we'll revisit the target amount for this goal later.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            See you in the next step!

                1. Well, isn't all math simply addition, multipilcation, and subtraction at its core? Further, subtraction is just the addition of a negative, and multiplication a shorter way of writing addition. (<a href="#footnote-math-goback">go back</a>)
