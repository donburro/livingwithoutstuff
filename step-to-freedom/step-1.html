        <p>
            Before going anywhere or doing anything, it is imperative to define what you want.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Define it <em>very clearly</em>. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Define it so clearly that there is no possible way for it to become anything else. If what you define has the ability to become something else, it will.
        </p>

            I wrote about goals and how to set good goals earlier.

            If your goal is to get fit, there are an infinite number of ways that you can accomplish that. 
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">
            Even if you only exercise <em>once</em> in the entire year, you've technically achieved your goal. 
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-2">
            You're <em>more</em> fit than you were before, right?
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">
            When we don't accomplish something that we said we were going to, we're inclined to <em>justify</em> what happened.
