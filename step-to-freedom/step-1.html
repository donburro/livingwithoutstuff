        <h2>What is it that you want, anyway?</h2>

        <p>
            Before going anywhere or doing anything, it is imperative to define what you want.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Define it <em>very clearly</em>. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Define it so clearly that there is no possible way for it to become anything else. If what you define has the ability to become something else, it will.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I wrote about what a good goal was 
            <a href="http://livingwithoutstuff.com#worry-intre">earlier</a>.
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">
            If your goal is to get fit, there are an infinite number of ways that you can accomplish that. 
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1" id="goal-footnote-return">
            Even if you only exercise <em>once</em> in the entire year, you've technically achieved your goal.
            <a href="#goal-footnote"><sup>1</sup></a>
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-2">
            You <em>are</em> more fit than you were before, right?
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">
            When we don't accomplish something that we said we were going to, we're inclined to <em>justify</em> what happened by telling ourselves that it wasn't meant to be after all, or that the level of accomplishment is what we were initially going for anyway. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            So for this step, all you need to do is write out why it is that you want to get FU Money. 
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">
            It can be anything you want. There are no rules here. My humble suggestion is that you make it something that you really want. The thing you want to avoid is getting right up to the finish line and turning around to continue the rat race. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Silly me, I realize that I haven't written about what is FU money yet.
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">
            Oh wait, 
            <a href="http://livingwithoutstuff.com#happy-hour">yes I have</a>.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Two years ago, I wanted FU Money to be able to leave my job at the large enterprise software company and take three months off before having to look for work again.
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">
            Clear. Straightforward. Accomplished, with some unexpected pleasant surprises along the way.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            This time, I have two distinct goals:
        </p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Move out of my parent's place and into an apartment I can call my own and prepay six months of rent.</li>
            <li>Take three months off work to work out.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>
            I wonder what suprises will arise this time around.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <strong>1. Move out of my parent's house</strong> <br />
            I've been living with my parents for the past two years because I felt like I needed to save money. When I moved back in with them, I had no idea how much I was actually making, no idea how much I was spending, and rent was one of those expenses that was a constant.
        </p>

        <p class="indent-1">
            You know, it's funny. When I decided to move back home, I thought to myself, <em>"Wow. Think of all the things I'll be able to buy with the money I don't spend on rent.</em>
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">
            Ah, how things change...
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <strong><em>Why do I want to do this?</em></strong>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I just feel like it's time. I want to have my own space to live, have friends over, and cook delicious things. My parent's place is nice - don't get me wrong, but there are things all over the place. You can't move or organize things because it's settled in a certain way that <em>doesn't need to be changed</em> because <em>it works just fine the way it is</em>. This is one of my biggest pet peeves.
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">
            "Well, what about this thing? It hasn't been used in forever, can we get rid of it? We don't even have the things that these chargers charge."
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-2">
            <em>"No! Don't throw things away like that! You never know when you'll need it! Then you'll need to go buy it at expensive prices! Thats a waste of money!"</em>
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">
            Yea, it's time...
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <em>Why prepay six months of rent?</em>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I've read stories about people getting a rent reduction if rent is pre-paid. I have no idea if this will work in San Francisco because rents have gone crazy and the people paying them insane. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            But, if it doesn't work, at least I'll have a pretty large cushion for rent. I don't living living paycheck to paycheck. 
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <strong>2. Take three months off to work out</strong> <br />
            I'm going to take some time off again, but I'm not going to <em>leave</em> my job this time. I'm just planning to take an unpaid leave of absence. I will also let my manager know well in advance.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <strong><em>Why do I want to do this?</em></strong>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I want to get in shape. I want to get bigger and put on muscle. I don't know how long it will take, but I think three months is a safe bet to get me started.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <em>Why not just do it while at work? Go to the gym! </em>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I have thought about doing this, but have learned that this is not the way that I work. If I do try to incorporate it into my life as it currently is, I'm likely to lose motivation after a month and fall back into the same rut.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I work best with introducting new things into my life during resets. <em>Total</em> resets. Start from scratch (hence, why I'm doing this right now), and build things up slowly until they're at an operational level. When I'm learning something new, I like to <em>dive in deep</em> and immerse myself in what I'm doing. I did this with my job for the last eight months, and nice, big fruit have appeared.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Plus, I believe that health is something that should be prioritized, not tacked on on top of everything else. Three months of immersion and learning as much as I can about it is going to be well worth it in the long run
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">
            I don't want to fit being healthy into my life. I want to make being healthy <em>part</em> of my life and then add on work.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Besides, if the world economy falls apart, the dollar collapses, and all else goes to hell, at least I'll be one of the few fit Americans able to lift. 
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">
            What the hell sort of benefit will a desk slave be able to provide in the post-apocalyptic world? Prepare a PDF report on the state of the world?
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">
            I can always get a new thing to do. I can't always get a new health.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            That's it for this step.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The next thing to do will be to figure out how much is needed for each of the goals.
