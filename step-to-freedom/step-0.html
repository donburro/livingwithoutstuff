    <h2>Getting to the starting line</h2>
    
    <p>
        Ok, to do this properly, I have to basically reset myself back to where I was at the end of 2015: 
        
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Disoriented</strong>, feeling that my finances were all over the place</li>
        <li><strong>Determined</strong> to get there</li>
        <li><strong>Unsure</strong> where to start</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
        Hmm. Well, I don't think I can go back to feeling 
        <span style="color: white; font-weight: bold"> disoriented.</span> 
        Even If I could, I don't think I would want to. I have a system that works pretty well for me right now, so in order to disorient myself, I would have to undo that system. Or, I suppose I could request a memory wipe.
    </p>
    
    <p class="indent-1">
        I'm not going to <em>undo</em> the system I've built. I'm going to <em>work within it</em>.
        
    </p>
    <p>
        Last time, my 
        <span style="color: white; font-weight: bold">determination</span> 
        to get there helped me by teaching me things about myself:
    </p>
    <p class="indent-1">
        What do I think of this? <br /> 
        How do I feel less confused about this? <br />
        What should I do in this situation? <br />
        How do I keep myself motivated?
    </p>
    
    <p>
        This time, since I already know the answers to these questions and have solutions to the challenges I'll face, my hope is that my determination to get there will help me by teaching me things about others. 
    </p>
    
    <p class="indent-1">
        Unexpected things happen when you do things differently than everybody else. Because I had already made up my mind to leave the large enterprise software company, I didn't properly consider the promotion offer I got. It might have been the best option at the time, but I had already decided emotionally that I wanted out.
    </p>
    
    <p class="indent-1">
        This time, I'm going to an open mind so that I can consider the options as they become available. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The thing I'm most
        <span style="color: white; font-weight: bold">unsure</span>
        about is how I'm going to reset myself back te where I was at the end of 2015. I know exactly where to start!
    </p>
    
    <p class="indent-1">
        In fact, I don't really have to do anything to get started. That's the beauty of having built a system: you don't have to do anything to keep it going except keep yourself going. 
    </p>
    
    <p class="indent-1">
        So I could just sit and wait until everything is in place, and then take the same end-game steps as before.
    </p>
    
    <p class="indent-2">
        Eh, but that's no fun.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        So here's what's going to happen for this step: I'll reset all my 
        <em>accounts</em> 
        to zero.
    </p>

    <h3>Current state of accounting</h3>
    <p> 
        Let's take a look into what my setup is for day-to-day living.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        I just grabbed a screenshot of the list from the budgeting software that I signed up for at the end of 2015 and still use.
            <sup id="footnote-1-top"><a href="#footnote-1-bottom">1</a></sup>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <strong>Spending account</strong>
        - this is the main account where all the exciting in-and-out action happens. Money comes in every month in the form of salary. Money comes out every month to pay the various credit card accounts accounts you can see.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        This account is going to be my main focus: Get that number to the desired value. We'll figure out what the desired value is after a few budgeting cycles.</p>
    
    <p>
        <strong>BofA Core Chk</strong>
        - an account that I opened with big bank corporation to get a $200 or $300 signup that they were offering. It has a minimum daily account balance of $1500 to avoid fees. I'm keeping it around because I'm using it to generate 15% returns on a small amount of money.
            <sup id="footnote-2-top"><a href="#footnote-2-bottom">2</a></sup>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        I have considered closing it, because even though the percentage gains are high, the actual amount of money is small. But, the amount of time I spend to get said gains is quite small. So for now, that's going to remain as it is. Worst case scenario, I can close it, grab the cash, and add it to the spending account. I won't mind foregoing those small gains.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <strong>Cash Held</strong>
        - I sold my car at the end of 2016 and the buyer paid in crisp $100 bills. The bills are sitting in my drawer with a binder clip keeping them together. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <strong>Venmo</strong>    
        - If I want to send money to a friend, I can subtract a number from my Venmo balance and make it appear in his Venmo balance. Basically cash, but electronic. It's connected to Spending Account. If I send more than what is currently in Venmo, it'll pull from Spending Account.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <strong>Credit Cards</strong>
        - I'm not going to go through these. You know what is a credit card. Note that the Barclays card has roughly $100Ï€.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        So, to reset these all to zero, I'll have to move points out of Spending Account, Cash Held, and Venmo. I'll have to think about what I want to do with BofA Core Chk, because I want to still track all credit card activity in my budget. I could move it out of the YNAB Realm but this makes things more complicated, which, as you might have guessed, I'm not a big fan of.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        I'll also have to leave just enough in the accounts to be able to cover existing credit card balances. I have an idea in mind on how to get myself to true zero. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Will be back with an update!
