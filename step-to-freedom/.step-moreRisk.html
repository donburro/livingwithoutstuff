            The completion of goal 1 couldn't have come at a better time, because there is some shit about to go down at work.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            And my job is on the line. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I don't care though, I just got <a href="https://donburro.github.io/livingwithoutstuff/posts/older-posts.html#happy-hour">FU Money</a>.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            This Friday, I'm going to have a chat with my manager. I'm going to tell him, in essence, that he has to commit to improving the culture with me, or I'm out. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            You see, I have determined that more than half of the people that work at the company are not happy, which means the company will never be successful, so really I'm saving myself time.
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">
            My manager is motivated by money, so he should relate.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            There are several things I would change, and I will offer that I have thought of many things, but some of these things will require my manager to do things he perceives as negative, so I'm offering to put in the effort to help fix things only if we go at it together. And if he does not want to, that's fine, but I have to go.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I'll be sure to offer a really good transition program. There is a new guy starting soon, I would fully train him up to replace me. 
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">
            And since new employees are always eager to make change, he will get all of my notes on what I would have changed anyway. He can decide what to do with them. It's really kind of are company property anyway.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Why does this not matter?</h3>
        
        <p>
            Anybody would say that going into your manager's office and saying you want to quit is crazy. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            But these people have never tried it, and probably are confusing it with rage quitting.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            This is not rage quitting.
        </p>
        
        <p id="cr-top">
            This is a calculated risk.<sup><a href="#cr-bot">1</a></sup>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            To see why it doesn't matter, let's look at the scenarios.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Scenario 1: I get canned on the spot</h4>
        
        <p>
            This is everyone's greatest fear about doing something like this, so let's start with it. We are going to go through the scenario in the order of increasing likelihood. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            This is the least likely thing to happen, unless you should have been fired a long time ago. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Think of it in terms of how much an inconvenience your sudden departure would be, both in terms of actual value provided and perceived future value provided. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Don't discount perceived future value. If you have been a well-performing asset during your service, your superiors will perceive that your contribution will continue to grow. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            My value is high enough that if I don't come in after the weekend, several things will have to be rebuilt. I also have a lot of institutional knowledge and goodwill within the organization. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            But it certainly wouldn't change much in the long run. The ship sails on.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            If it does manage to happen for some strange reason, I have six months of rent sitting there so I can go on long vacation and still get a better job with the extreme comfort of time.
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">
            If this is your first time doing this, you are still probably pretty scared that this will be the scenario. I was too the first time I did this. 
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">
            All I can tell you at this point is, if you're still scared, you should face your fear directly and see what happens.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Scenario 2: I provide a smooth transition to the next guy</h4>
        
        <p class="quote">
            Hey, here's what I'll do. I'll stick around and make sure that all of my stuff is transferred over to the new guy that's starting, and I'll make sure that he's even better than me. That way, you won't have to worry about replacing me and it will be less likely that something falls through the cracks.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            My manager is a super busy guy. Reports directly to the man in charge. One weekend, I felt how he feels probably every weekend, and it didn't feel good.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            So I know he wouldn't decline this offer. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            This is also the way to go if you want to leave on really good terms.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Everybody would want to hire you again if you go out this way. Not that you'd ever want to get hired back there again... but when people leave the company and go work elsewhere, you'll still know each other. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The benefit for me is that I get to complete goal 2, because I'll get to stay another quarter or so.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Scenario 3: My manager commits to improving the culture</h4>
        
        <p>
            Whew, then some real fun begins.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Who knows what will happen? I don't.</p>
        
        <h4>Scenario 4: I get mind-tricked into staying and nothing changes</h4>
        
        <p>
            Strangely enough, knowing the culture of the small enterprise software company I work for, this scenario seems likely enough a possibility to think about what I would do in this case. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Ideally, what I would want to do is realize that this scenario happened and course-correct to one of the other scenarios. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            This scenario is dangerous precisely because it is one of the other scenarios in disguise. I want to be able to identify this scenario and kill it before too long. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I will propose a major change to the way we run a certain aspect of our business and see what happens. 
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">
            If the idea of change -- not the idea itself -- is met with resistance, or not supported, I'll know I'm in scenario 4.
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">
            If something improves, here we go scenario 3.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Scenario switch</h4>
        
        <p>
            Oh, you can change scenarios at any time. If I end up in scenario 3 and it turns out my job is made a living hell, I can enact scenario 1 immediately.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Scenario 1 is always available. You can keep it in your back pocket.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I personally hope that scenario 3 happens. But even if it doesn't I'm ok with it. 
        </p>
        
        
        <h3>All paths lead to one place</h3>
        
        <p>
            There's a reason you started this whole thing, and that's where you'll end up. What happens between now and when you get there is the journey. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Then, as you get to the end of that journey, you realize that it didn't ever end and your story goes on.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Normally, I would be really stressed out right now. If I were right out of academia, I would be pulling an all-nighter to get a bunch of stuff ready for tomorrow, because someone requested it at the last minute.  
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">
            Oh man, if you knew who made the request... </p>
        
        <p>
            Make no mistake about it: because you have <a href="step-6">imagined something strongly enough</a>, it will become reality. There's no other way it can turn out. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            So at this point, enjoy the ride. Take risks by doing what you think is right. You might piss people off by doing it, and you might be wrong, but at least you were true to yourself. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            And, whatever. You have FU Money.
        </p>
        
        <h2>What you should do for this step</h2>
        
        <p>
            Identify something risky you can do and do it.
