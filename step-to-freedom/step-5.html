            The post-budget-set-up life
        </h2>
        
        <p>
            Now that you've got your budget set up, there's not too much else you need to do with it for a few months. 
        </p>
        
        <div class="inline-image">

        <p class="indent-1">
            Well, you know, except every day or so when you should log in and categorize your transactions before it's been too long and you forget what it was and you have to rack your brain to remember.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Just keep living your life, opening your budget every few days to categorize the transactions as they come in.
        </p>

            If you pay for things in cash like I'm going to be doing for the next few months, add that transaction manually.

            And then, as you go about your days exchanging points for goods and services, the numbers on the screen will change.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            You can also run some nice reports to see how things add up.
            But since we only have less than one month's worth of data right now, so it won't be too helpful at the current time.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            But it might be fun to look into it anyway, just for fun... To see how we did in January.

            You may have noticed that since last time, my cash balance has increased quite a bit. Well, it's because I decided to focus my efforts on dealing drugs as my side hustle. Curiously, most of the clients insist paying in cash even though I have an account with Square to take credit and debit cards.

            One thing I'm gonna have to do is deposit some cash into Spending Account because I don't have enough funds to cover all of my credit cards...</p>
        
        <p>
            One thing that happened to me when I started budgeting was that I changed my spending habits because I <em>knew</em> that they were now being tracked and I wanted to drive my monthly spending number as low as possible. There's a reason for it and against it, so let's talk about each one.
        </p>
        
        <p id="bullshit-footnote-top">
            <strong>Actively try not to spend that much</strong> <br />
            Things that made me do this was starting a budget at the same time as I set a spending forecast for myself. I had no idea how much I was spending each month, so my spending forecast was calculated by making intelligent assumptions and educated calculations.
            <sup><a href="#bullshit-footnote">2</a></sup>
        </p>
        
        <p> 
            I took that $21&nbsp000 number, divided by 12, and burned the resulting monthly figure of $1&nbsp750 into my brain.
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">
            Every time I bought something, went out to eat, filled up gas - did anything that required money, I unconsciously thought about where I was in relation to that number for the month.
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">
            If I came in one month way below $1&nbsp750, then I would feel great about it, while also understanding that I could <em>just spend that much more</em> next month and the figures would average out to $1&nbsp750. And that's exactly what would happen, almost as if I were rewarding myself for my hard work of saving last month.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            At the end of the year, almost like a self-fulfilling prophecy, my total spending was $21&nbsp101. After tallying my points for December, I remember feeling elated and relieved - I had hit my number! It was a great feeling. I had accomplished something in my life. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            But looking back on it, I realize it was quite an unimpressive accomplishment. It had caused me so much stress that I hated this budgeting thing that I had made a part of my life. Whenever I spent a lot of money, I dreaded opening up YNAB a few days later and having to categorize the transactions. 
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">
            Going out with friends stopped being fun. I didn't want to travel as much. I didn't want to buy <em>anything</em>, and things that I did want to buy, I tormented over because I had <em>wasted money</em>.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            $1&nbsp750 became my god. 
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">
            My advice to you now is to not let any number become your god, especially one that has the power to give you a significant amount of stress if things go wrong.
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-2">
            Although, at the end of the day, I will say that it change the way I thought about money for the better. I learned that living in a penny-pinching mode was not healthy, and that I should really have zero worry when I reach into my pocket to pay for something. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            In hindsight, $21&nbsp000 wasn't challenging enough. If I had set my number to $17&nbsp000, I probably would have hit it because my god would have been slightly lower by being just that much more miserable.
        </p>

        
        <p>
            <strong>Don't change anything</strong> <br />
            This is the way I'm doing it this time. I don't want to go through the same thing as before, so I'm not even setting target amounts for any of my budget line items this year. I hate putting myself into cages - I want to be free to spend wherever I choose. I think there are much, much better, and <em>healthier</em> ways to figure out whether to spend on something than whether or not it will fit into your budget.
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">
            Just think for a second about the mentality that builds. If you don't do something you want because it doesn't fit into a rigid budget category, what happens?
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-2">
            You're saying, <em>"there's only so much money in my life, and I need to save for the things that matter"</em> and end up building a self-defeating scarcity mindset, when you'd much rather want an abundance mindset.
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">
            If you think it will add value to your life, you should be able to get it without thinking about your budget. There's a whole digression we can go on here about what that means and why abundance is better, but Robert Kiyosaki 
            <a href="http://www.richdad.com/Resources/Rich-Dad-Financial-Education-Blog/September-2012/how-can-i-afford-that.aspx" target="_blank">is better equipped to talk about it</a> 
            than myself. 
        </p>
        
        
        
        <p>
            This would have been an interesting thing to do because I would have been able to see what my spending habits were like before my mind got all caught up in budgeting and saving. I don't have an easily-accessible record of how I used to spend and think about money before I started budgeting. 
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">
            I <em>could</em> go back and try to put something together from old credit card statements, but I have closed the checking accounts so my debit card transactions would be missing. Plus it sounds like a great deal of work that would only yield an "oh, that's interesting." Looking at the past isn't always worth it. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            If you <em>do</em> start with this route, what you'll get after a few cycles is a pretty solid understanding of how much you spend each month, and as the months go on, you'll only be adjusting this number up and down in smaller and smaller amounts.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The other great thing about this method is that if you don't yet intuitively know whether something matters to you, or if you're trying to fix a spending problem, you'll have to get better.
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">
            Remember, your budget will force you to see a lot of things, whether you want to see them or not. 
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-2">
            A problem is much easier to solve if you see it clearly.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <strong>Conclusion</strong><br />
            Because you have decided to start budgeting, it doesn't matter what choice you make here at all. Just like choosing what budgeting software to use in the previous step, just pick one. No matter what you do here, you'll reach the same place at the end.
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">
            Here you have two options, so a coin would work just fine.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Because you have already started, there is little that can throw you off track. And the added benefit of subsequent decisions being less influential on your journey is also nice.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The best decision you made was deciding to keep a budget, then taking the first step to get it going.
        </p>
        
        <h2>What you should do for this step</h2>
        
        <p>
            Log in to your budget every once in a while and spend the less-than-5-minutes it takes to apply categories to your transations.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Other than that, just keep being the best person you can be.
        </p>
