            At this point I'm too tired to write.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            When I sat in bed, my workstation's battery was 55%. Just before coming upstairs, I had a really strong desire to write. I got distracted with all sorts of different other tasks on the computer and didn't actually start writing this until 25%. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <em></em>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Now if I were to keep writing, it would be forced because my desire to get to sleep outweighs my desire to write.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            So here are a few topics I thought about writing today:
        </p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>An interview with a Doctor on the radio full of cognitive dissonance</li>
            <li>Working for time is more efficient than working for money</li>
            <li>Why some people want to control everything</li>
            <li>What does the title of this page have to do with anything?</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>
            Goodnight!
        </p>

        <p>
            Recently I had gotten caught up in what I always complain everybody else gets caught up in: I started watching the news.
        </p>

        <p>
            It started because I got really into listening to Frank Zappa's music, which appear innocent and trivial on the surface, but he's really making fun of almost all of society, including the people that listen to his music to be cool, but don't know what he says.
        </p>

        <p>
            Then, I tumbled upon "other videos I might like" and some were documentaries of how we're all doomed for one reason or another and only have a few decades left before we all again decline into another worldwide war, this time due to the scarcity of critical resources.
        </p>

        <p>
            <em>Just have a look at my recent youtube history:</em>
        </p>

        <img src="images/a-trip-down-zappa-lane/youtube_history_05_17_1.png"/>

        <p>
            Start off with the normal cruft I listen to, along with some tunes that allow me to reminisce about college.
        </p>

        <p>
            So far, just music.
        </p>

        <img src="images/a-trip-down-zappa-lane/youtube_history_05_17_2.png"/>

        <p>
            Here we see a viewing of a video offering an explanation to Carl Jung's Synchronicity, before returning to finer works such as "To All My Niggas" and "Drug Ballard."
        </p>

        <img src="images/a-trip-down-zappa-lane/youtube_history_06_17_1.png" />

        <p>
            I come back to the Youtube after a six week summer break.
        </p>

        <p> 
            During the early part of this time, I read a book called <i>The Power of Habit</i> and decided that I would set out to create a habit for myself.
        </p>

        <p>
            The habit that I wanted to create was a daily routine where I would get up in the morning, have one hour to do my own work, and return home from work at a reasonable hour to get to bed in order to wake up early enough. 
        </p>

        <p>
            I experimented with a spoonful of honey if I woke up early enough.
        </p>

        <p>
            This lasted consistently for a duration of about three or four weeks, after which point things would change, get in the way of the habit, and I'd find a lecture by Alan Watts called "The Importance of Discipline".
        </p>

        <p>
            <em>Yup, life changed and for whatever reason, I couldn't keep up the habit.</em> Maybe the reward wasn't good enough. Maybe the content of the work wasn't entertaining enough. Maybe I wasn't motivated enough to keep going on whatever I was doing.
        </p>

        <p>
            I think it's the last one.
        </p>

        <p>
            My intention with viewing "The Importance of Discipline" may have been to justify the reasons I was creating a habit, and look for clues as to how to improve my own discipline. But Youtube drew my attention to other videos I might be interested in, like "What Makes You a Mature Adult" and "How to Stop Overthinking." 
        </p>

        <p>
            Needless to say, it got me.
        </p>

        <img src="images/a-trip-down-zappa-lane/youtube_history_06_17_2.png" />

        <p>
            Whenever I watch John Oliver, I end up feeling depressed about the state of the world, so I would turn to old classics in a few days to help cheer me up.
        </p>

        <p>
            Up next I would revisit the wonderful work of Frank Sinatra, Eminem, and the soundtracks of some childhood games Tony Hawks Pro Skater and Need For Speed (on repeat!) with day stops back at Alan Watts and Hardstyle livesets every so often.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Here is where its gets interesting:</strong><br />
            A colleague in marketing had sent out a Youtube video used to justify the existence of our product. <em>"This would be a great thing for our customers to understand"</em> he said. The video he sent out is at the top.
        </p>

        <img src="images/a-trip-down-zappa-lane/youtube_history_07_17_1.png" />

        <p>
            It's a recording of a presentation given by the NSA TAO Chief on how they think about  hacking into and spying on various adversarial groups without being discovered. 
        </p>

        <p>
            One of the suggestions after this video was made by someone doing producer's version voice-over comments of the TAO video, pointing out all the various ways he used deceptive language to say one thing but really mean another. The great irony is that a man is telling an audience exactly how his employer invades their privacy and they still applaud at the end of the speech.
        </p>

        <p>
            This started me down the path that eventually got me to Frank Zappa, and from there, the rest is history (that we'll be reviewing).
        </p>

        <p>
            I finished up the day of the we're-all-cyber-doomed-themed videos with a review of such classics as "WHAT TUPAC/FRANK ZAPPA WANTED YOU TO KNOW" after which I felt lost and disgusted in humanity. How could we have gotten to this point where people are just a mass of sheep that can be controlled, pushed around, and experimented on without any reprocussion for those high up. Doesn't anyone care? Deosn't anyone want to do the right thing for their brothers in society?
        </p>

        <p>
            How awful my mind must have felt after that. I went back to the Alan Watts lectures a few days later in attempt to find greater meaning and not feel so down about myself. If I could find an explanation of why things are as they are (<em>It's all just human nature at the end of the day</em>) I would feel better about the whole situation that Tupac and Frank talked about. Maybe.
        </p>

        <p>
            Maybe not. I seem to search upon Trout Mask Replica when things are all crazy and I need to listen to crazy music because everything else just doesn't really help. 
        </p>

        <p>
            It was the first thing that I put on the first day of August. The guy known as Frank Zappa, having himself worked with Captain Beefheart, were recommended videos. An old friend's high regard for his music made me just curious enough to try to find out for myself what made his music so special.
        </p>

        <p>
            I got hooked.
        </p>

        <p>
            For the next month I would consume as much as I could of Frank's music. Every chance I got, I would play it: At work, cooking, playing board games, in the car. It was perfectly designed for my consumption. It "spoke to me."
        </p>

        <p>
            Of course, there would be days where I would put on the standard THPS soundtrack or Hardstyle sets, but I would continue to come back to Zappa tunes.
        </p>

        <a id="zappa-break"></a>

        <p>
            If you'd like to take a break from reading this for a month and constantly listen to Frank Zappa for a month, now would be a good time to give it a try and see how it makes you feel. This post will still be here when you get back. You can bookmark <a href="#zappa-break">this link</a> to come back exactly here. I'm not going to attempt to describe the feeling because I feel that I will do a horrible job at it. Best to experience it for yourself.
        </p>

        <p>
            After all was said and done, the topic of videos that I landed on was <em>money</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
            <em>Everything leads back to money.</em>
            Check it out: 
        </p>

        <img src="images/a-trip-down-zappa-lane/youtube_history_09_17_1.png"/>

        <p>
            On the same day I finally grew tired of listening to Zappa all day, I stared watching videos about money.
        </p>

        <p>
            At first, the topics were innocent and widely relatable. The gateway video was an early retirement update from Mike & Lauren who just purchased a warehouse. That lead to a video about how much Americans are screwed for retirement because of a lack of savings and a recent financial downturn (the 2008 one in this case).
        </p>

        <p>
            Following this I watched some videos from BeatTheBush, who offers surprisingly simple and upbeat advice about how to save a lot of money while still being able to drive a sports car to work.
        </p>

        <p>
            And then...
        </p>

        <img src="images/a-trip-down-zappa-lane/youtube_history_overdose.png"/>

        <p>
            Crisis.
        </p>

        <p>
            When will it hit? What should I do? I know that it's coming, should I sell now so I can lock in the gains? Will my 401k be all right? Should I really be in a Roth 401k? Gee, I should think about this some more.
        </p>

        <img src="images/a-trip-down-zappa-lane/youtube_history_401k.png"/>

        <p>
            Oh God, I'm scaring myself about my 401k now. Why have I tried to max it out every year? Is there something better I could have done with it? 60 Minutes ran a peice on why you should <em>NEVER</em> own a 401k! Is it all just another trap?
        </p>

        <img src="images/a-trip-down-zappa-lane/youtube_history_09_17_2.png"/>

        <p>
            Well, there goes the neighborhood. We're all living in the Matrix. Nothing is real. Everything is a construction. We're all rats running around and around in a cage for someone else's gain until we can't go on and fall over. At the last moment, we wonder what we spent our only life doing.
        </p>

        <img src="images/a-trip-down-zappa-lane/youtube_history_cage.png"/>

        <p>
            In order to escape from a cage, you must first realize that you are in one.
        </p>

        <img src="images/a-trip-down-zappa-lane/youtube_history_09_17_3.png"/>

        <p>
            I should mention that none of what I was watching was overly shocking to me. I like to think I understand how the world works better than most people. While the way I have been writing may make it seem like I was going through some sort of enlightenment, I was merely watching these videos and thinking to myself <em>"Yup, thought so. Makes total sense. What's wrong with people these days?"</em>
        </p>


        <ul>
            <li><em>Financial crisis coming again soon?</em> Yup, sure is.</li>
            <li><em>401k vs Roth 401k?</em> Studied it plenty. </li>
            <li><em>The United States of America Limited is a private corporation based in Edinburg?</em> Yea, I can see that.</li>
            <li><em>Human extinction by 2030?</em> It's a bit overblown maybe, but they make a compelling argument.</li>
            <li><em>Drive without a license?</em> Oh, I should look into that. I hate paying DMV license fees...</li>
        </ul>


        <p>
            But wait, <strong><em>So what?</em></strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            The elephant in the room here is that I would regularly try to explain to people that what they shouldn't get worked up about what they see in the news because all that it's doing is affecting their happiness and outlook on life.
        </p>

        <p>
            So what have I been going through this past few months?
        </p>

        <p>
            How am I any different from the people who get caught up in mainstream media? Is what I have been watching any different really?
        </p>

        <p>
            If the average person were to watch the documentary "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cg2VtbRr8qM">SHADOW GOVERNMENT Who Rules America?</a>" they would most likely brush it off as a bunch of incoherent gobbledygook and think I'm crazy to give it even an ounce of credibility.
        </p>

        <p>
            But then, I'll turn around around to the latest news about how the President just made a horrible foreign relations blunder and call IT a bunch of incoherent gobbledygook that's designed to keep the masses entertained, disappointed, and distracted.
        </p>

        <p>
            So, I'm a hypocrite. I fell into the trap that I advise others to avoid - often to no avail.
        </p>

        <p>
            These things are <em>nice to know</em>. It's nice to know how the world works. It's nice to know some of the ways that thinking is manipulated. It's nice to know that severe resource shortage may be the driving force behind the next global war.
        </p>

        <p>
           But right now, So what? Who cares? How is me worrying about this right now going to affect my life in any way?
        </p>

        <p>
            All that it's doing is making me feel worse about something I have very little control over. I'm just like the person who reads about America pulling out of the Paris Accords and feeling sad for humanity.
        </p>
