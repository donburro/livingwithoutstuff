            In the last post, I linked to a post I had written on DDBS. It's actually becoming a very good example of a project that I start but doesn't end up anywhere because I get too busy, lose motivation, or [insert other reason here].
        </p> 
        
        <p>
            And with most of my time now dedicated to work, it becomes harder to spend long periods of time writing blog posts that I consider good enough. During the little bit of time I'm not at work, I tend to want to kick back and relax or hang out with friends. There's always something that I want to write about in the back of my head though... [foreshadowing alert]
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">
            This is where <em>this</em> site kind of comes into play. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I've set my goal for this year to simplify my life as much as I can. I also detailed that decision in another post I wrote on DDBS.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I wrote that it was really an incredibly vague goal, and I wasn't really sure what it meant or how it would work.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Vague goals are very hard to accomplish because there are no concrete things you can immediately latch onto and the measure of success is subjective.
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">
            'Getting fit' is a vague goal.
            <br /><br />
            'Going to a specific gym M-W-F before work for one hour' is a specific goal. You can immediately do a thing like plan out your morning ritual to make it happen and it's easy to measure it's success.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Last year's goal was specific - it was a number-based goal. All I had to do was to get a number as close to another as possible. That was easy enough to do.
        </p>

        <p>
            The thing I have to do is to translate my vague goal into a specific goal like the one about gettin fit.
        </p>    
        
        <p class="indent-1">
            But the problem is I'm not sure how to translate it.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I'll just try something and see if it makes sense. Can't hurt even if it fails.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I think one way of measuring how simple your life is by the count of things you worry about. If I spend too much time worrying about something, it takes away time from other things that I could be doing. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Plus, it's not healthy. Isn't worry related to stress somehow?
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">
            I should know. I don't feel good when I'm worried.
        </p>    
        
        <p>
            This is what I'll do: I will take note of all the things things that worry me. No matter what it is, big or small, I will record it. After two weeks of record keeping, I will review my worries.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I can retroactively start this list here (although I'm going to use a text editor on my phone for entry on-the-go) from the last post.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Last night's worry was, essentially:<br />
            - I'm worried about not finishing my work because my manager might get mad.
        </p>

        <p>
            I realize that what comes after 'because' is important, becase that provides a starting point for further analysis which could help me rationalize why I shouldn't have that worry. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Everything should go on this list. Every time I have a worry, I need to pick up my phone and write it down. I need to create a new habit loop. Since this is a new habit, it should be easier to form than if it were an existing habit.
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">
            But wait, I already have worries, so this might actually be trying to alter a new habit. In which case, I need to identify and understand my existing habit loop.
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-2">
            Or I could just get started without overthinking the whole thing.
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">
            I can tell that I'm kind of addicted to porn because I thought for a split second that whacking it each time could be a good reward. Not very practical though. Imagine doing that at work...
        </p>
        
        
        <p>
            The trigger is having a worry. Whenever I have a worry, I need to have myself associate it with a reward. What's a good reward? What can I reward myself with after having just written down a worry, phone in hand? 
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">
            Hmm... What about posting the worry to Twitter? People get gratification when they submit something to the internet. But is it only if they get likes or people retweet? I'll get zero retweets. What if I find it not rewarding and stop? What if...? We can continue down the 'What if' hole a long time
            
        </p>
            
        <p class="indent-2">
            Then I'll just change the reward...
        </p>
    
        <p class="indent-1">      
            I want to think of another reward so I have two options to choose between. 
 
            <br /><br />
            
            Can I motivate myself with money? I could allocate $20 for every worry I write down for something. But It would be my money, and if I were to do anything with it, I could just do it anyway.
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-2">
            Plus, money is a horrible motivator and might motivate me to come up with false worries so I can allocate more to something. And it's hard for me to be objective with my own worries.
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">    
            I just read this: <a href="http://jamesclear.com/habit-triggers">The 5 Triggers That Make New Habits Stick</a>
            
            <br /><br />
            
            I can do something with emotional state.
 
            <br /><br />
            
            The emotional state I get when I worry will remind me to take out my phone and write down what I'm worried about. After writing it down, I'll feel better about having written it down to deal with it later. That'll be the reward.
 
            <br /><br />
            
            Hmm, I like the idea of posting to Twitter more. It actually results in the emotional state reward as well!
            
        </p>

        All right. Time to start a new twitter account, @livingwithoutstuff!

            Let's say I want to go to my company's happy hour, but I promised to send something out by EOD today to a colleague to forward off to a customer. What do I do?
        </p>

        <p>
            I get up and go to my company's happy hour.
        </p>

        <p class="indent-1">
            <em>What.</em>
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">
            <em>You promised a deliverable, you should finish it!</em>
        </p>

        <p>
            I should continue sitting at my desk until I got the thing done, no matter how long it takes? What if everybody leaves by the time I finish?
        </p>

        <p class="indent-1">
            <em>But won't your manager get mad?</em>
        </p>

        <p>
            Maybe, but why should I care if someone at work gets mad at me? What is anyone gonna do? Am I going to get fired? Are they going to hold it against me when we're selling software to big ass enterprise companies that never have their 'automated business workflows' shit together? Are they going to not do business with us because we didn't get an email out on Friday night? 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Let's try to look at it from the recipient's point of view:
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">
            You are manager of information technology at one of the largest companies in the world. You've been at your company anywhere from five to twenty years and you enjoy the work-life balance that your job provides. Your in-office hours are 8:00 to 17:00, and all of your coworkers know this. They know better than to ask you for something important at ten to four on Friday. You have a host of issues to deal with in your day-to-day, but you also have to stay on top of new technologies in your space, so you end up having to talk to a bunch of vendors that are <em>always</em> promising to fix <em>most</em>, but not all, of your problems.
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">    
            Are you going to step away from your Friday night plans to go review what it is some little-but-quickly-growing-startup-with-the-latest-and-greatest-make-the-world-a-better-place-for-real technology company's sales team sent them? 
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">
            Hell no. That's gonna happen on Monday... Maybe Tuesday, or by the end of next week at least.
        </p>

        <p class="indent-1">
            Wait, was a vendor supposed to send me something today?
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Well, I should probably get that out on Sunday before getting in... you know, just so that nobody asks why I didn't finish it...
        </p>
        
        <p>
            So, I think one way to think about this is to start interacting with your customers the way they interact with you. <em>You mirror them</em>. If we miss something, we say "sorry it's taking longer than expected" and just reschedule the meeting or deliverable for another time. People reschedule meetings with people all the time, lol. 
        </p>

        <p class="indent-1">
            "Hey, sorry, realized that this Friday I was gonna be out so can we reschedule that meeting where I was going to come to your office where you have meetings all day every day? Sorry to ruin our relationship, hopefully we can meet next week instead. Thanks"
        </p>

        <p>
            Nothing bad is gonna happen as long as I have <a href="http://dontdumbbesmart.com/fu">FU Money</a>.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            And if it does, so what? I have FU Money!
        </p>
        
        <img src="images/keep_calm_with_fu_money.png"/>
        
        <p>
            I need to follow my advice a bit more. Work is getting to a point where it's becoming more annoying than interesting on a day-to-day basis.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I need to remember the lessons that FU money taught me last year and use them to restore balance to the force.
        </p>

            At this point I'm too tired to write.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            When I sat in bed, my workstation's battery was 55%. Just before coming upstairs, I had a really strong desire to write. I got distracted with all sorts of different other tasks on the computer and didn't actually start writing this until 25%. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Now if I were to keep writing, it would be forced because my desire to get to sleep outweighs my desire to write.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            So here are a few topics I thought about writing today:
        </p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>An interview with a Doctor on the radio full of cognitive dissonance</li>
            <li>Working for time is more efficient than working for money</li>
            <li>Why some people want to control everything</li>
            <li>What does the title of this page have to do with anything?</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>
            Goodnight!
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <em>PS: I did enjoy reading and editing the previous post. It's now down to 14%</em>

        <p>
            Recently I got caught up in something I always advise people not to do: I started watching the news and taking it too seriously.
        </p>

        <p>
            It started because I got really into listening to Frank Zappa's music, which appears innocent and trivial on the surface, but it's really making fun of almost all of society, being so brilliantly deceptive that even the very people that the music calls stupid love it.
        </p>

        <p>
            Then, I tumbled upon "other videos I might like" and some were documentaries of how we're all doomed for one reason or another and only have a few decades left before we all again decline into another worldwide war, this time due to the scarcity of critical resources.
        </p>

        <p>
            <em>Just have a look at my recent youtube history:</em>
        </p>

        <img src="images/a-trip-down-zappa-lane/youtube_history_05_17_1.png"/>

        <p>
            Start off with the normal cruft I listen to, along with some tunes that allow me to reminisce about college.
        </p>

        <p>
            So far, just music.
        </p>

        <img src="images/a-trip-down-zappa-lane/youtube_history_05_17_2.png"/>

        <p>
            Here we see a viewing of a video offering an explanation of Carl Jung's Synchronicity, before returning to the finer works "To All My Niggas" and "Drug Ballard."
        </p>

        <img src="images/a-trip-down-zappa-lane/youtube_history_06_17_1.png" />

        <p>
            I come back to the Youtube after a six week summer break.
        </p>

        <p> 
            During the early part of this time, I read a book called <i>The Power of Habit</i> and decided that I would set out to create a habit for myself.
        </p>

        <p>
            The habit that I wanted to create was a daily routine where I would get up in the morning, have one hour to do my own work, and return home from work at a reasonable hour to get to bed in order to wake up early enough. 
        </p>

        <p>
            I experimented with a spoonful of honey as my reward if I woke up early enough the next morning.
        </p>

        <p>
            This lasted consistently for a duration of about three or four weeks, after which point things would change, get in the way of the habit, and I'd find a lecture called "The Importance of Discipline".
        </p>

        <p>
            <em>Yup, life changed and for whatever reason, I couldn't keep up the habit.</em> Maybe the reward wasn't good enough. Maybe the content of the work wasn't entertaining enough. Maybe I wasn't motivated enough to keep going on whatever I was doing.
        </p>

        <p>
            I think it's the last one.
        </p>

        <p>
            My intention with viewing "The Importance of Discipline" may have been to justify my reasons creating a habit, and look for clues as to how to improve my own discipline. But Youtube drew my attention to other videos I might be interested in, like "What Makes You a Mature Adult" and "How to Stop Overthinking." 
        </p>

        <p>
            Needless to say, it got me.
        </p>

        <img src="images/a-trip-down-zappa-lane/youtube_history_06_17_2.png" />

        <p>
            Whenever I watch John Oliver, I end up feeling depressed about the state of the world, so I would turn to old classics a few days later to help cheer me up.
        </p>

        <p>
            Up next I would revisit the wonderful work of Frank Sinatra, Eminem, and the soundtracks of some of my favorite childhood games - Tony Hawks Pro Skater and Need For Speed (on repeat!) - with day stops back at Alan Watts and Hardstyle livesets every so often.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Here is where its gets interesting:</strong><br />
            A colleague in marketing had sent out a Youtube video in order to internally justify the existence of our product. <em>"This would be a great thing for our customers to understand"</em> he said. The video he sent out is at the top of this next list:
        </p>

        <img src="images/a-trip-down-zappa-lane/youtube_history_07_17_1.png" />

        <p>
            It's a recording of a presentation given by the NSA TAO Chief on how they think about  hacking into and spying on various adversarial groups without being discovered. 
        </p>

        <p>
            One of the suggestions after this video was made by someone doing producer's version voice-over comments of the TAO video, pointing out all the various ways he used deceptive language to say one thing but really mean another - The great irony being that a man is telling an audience exactly how his employer invades their privacy and they still applaud at the end of the speech.
        </p>

        <p>
            This started me down the path that eventually got me to Frank Zappa, and from there, the rest is history (that we'll be reviewing).
        </p>

        <p>
            After watching several we're-all-cyber-doomed-themed videos, I somehow stumbled upon "WHAT TUPAC/FRANK ZAPPA WANTED YOU TO KNOW" after which I felt lost and disgusted in humanity. How could we have gotten to this point where people are just a sheepish mass that are controlled, pushed around, and experimented on without their knowledge or any reprocussion for those pulling the strings? Doesn't anyone care? Deosn't anyone notice? Are peopel so ignoran? Does nobody want to do the right thing for the greater good of society?
        </p>

        <p>
            How awful I must have felt after that. I went back to the Alan Watts lectures a few days later in attempt to find greater meaning and not feel so down about myself. If I could find an explanation of why things are as they are (<em>It's all just human nature at the end of the day</em>) I would feel better about what Tupac and Frank talked about. Maybe.
        </p>

        <p>
            Maybe not. I seem to search upon Trout Mask Replica when things are all crazy and I need to listen to crazy music because everything else just doesn't really help. 
        </p>

        <p>
            It was the first thing that I put on the first day of August. Music by a guy known as Frank Zappa, having himself worked with Captain Beefheart, were in the recommended videos sidebar. An old friend's high regard for his music made me just curious enough to try to find out for myself what made his music so special.
        </p>

        <p>
            I gave it a shot.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I got hooked.
        </p>

        <p>
            For the next month I would consume as much as I could of Frank's music. Every chance I got, I would play it: At work, cooking, playing board games, in the car. It was perfectly designed for my consumption. It "spoke to me."
        </p>

        <p>
            Of course, there would be days where I would put on the standard THPS soundtrack or Hardstyle sets, but I would continue to come back to Zappa.
        </p>

        <a id="zappa-break"></a>

        <p>
            If you'd like to take a break from reading this and constantly listen to Frank Zappa for a month, now would be a good time to give it a try and see how it makes you feel. This post will still be here when you get back. You can bookmark <a href="#zappa-break">this link</a> to come back exactly here. I'm not going to attempt to describe the feeling because experience is the fastest way to understand something.
        </p>

        <p>
            After all was said and done, the topic of videos that I landed on was <em>money</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
            <em>Everything leads back to money.</em>
            Check it out: 
        </p>

        <img src="images/a-trip-down-zappa-lane/youtube_history_09_17_1.png"/>

        <p>
            On the same day I finally grew tired of listening to Zappa all day, I stared watching videos about money.

            At first, the topics were innocent and widely relatable. The gateway video was an early retirement update from Mike & Lauren who just purchased a warehouse. That lead to a video about how much Americans are screwed for retirement because of a lack of savings and a recent financial downturn (the 2008 one in this case).

        <p>
            Following this I watched some videos from BeatTheBush, who offers surprisingly simple and upbeat advice about how to save a lot of money while still being able to drive a sports car to work.

            And then...

            Crisis.
        </p>

        <p>
            When will it hit? What should I do? I know that it's coming, should I sell now so I can lock in the gains? Will my 401k be all right? Should I really be in a Roth 401k? Gee, I should think about this some more.

        <p>
            Oh God, I'm scaring myself about my 401k now. Why have I tried to max it out every year? Is there something better I could have done with it? 60 Minutes ran a peice on why you should <em>NEVER</em> own a 401k! Is it all just another trap? I know they exist. Is this a trap?

            Well, there goes the neighborhood. We're all living in the Matrix. Nothing is real. Everything is a construction. We're all rats running around and around in a cage for someone else's gain until we can't go on and fall over. At the last moment before we croak, we wonder what we spent our only life doing.

            In order to escape from a cage, you must first realize that you are in one.

            I should mention that none of what I was watching was overly shocking to me. I like to think I understand how the world works better than most people. While the way I have been writing may make it seem like I was going through some sort of enlightenment, I was merely watching these videos and thinking to myself <em>"Yup, thought so. Makes total sense. What's wrong with people these days?"</em>
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong style="color: beige">I was consuming content that reaffirmed my already-accepted beliefs.</strong>
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><em>Financial crisis coming again soon?</em> Yup, sure is.</li>
            <li><em>401k vs Roth 401k?</em> Studied it plenty. </li>
            <li><em>The United States of America Limited is a private corporation based in Edinburg?</em> Duh, America is an oligarchy.</li>
            <li><em>Human extinction by 2030?</em> It's a bit overblown maybe, but they make a compelling argument. We are beginning to fight over water...</li>
            <li><em>Drive without a license?</em> Oh, I should look into that. I hate paying DMV license fees...</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            I wasn't really learning anything. Everything I was consuming was just reminding me how fucked up everything is and how helpless I am to do anything about it. Even if I wanted to, there's little I can do to convince <em>enough people</em> to take action to ensure a better future for upcoming generations. That battle is lost, and that makes me feel really sad.</p>

        <p>
            But wait, <strong><em>So what?</em></strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            The elephant in the room here is that I regularly try to explain to people that  they shouldn't get worked up about what they see in the news because all that it's doing is affecting their happiness and outlook on life.
        </p>

        <p>
            So what have I been going through this past few months?
        </p>

        <p>
            How am I any different from the people who get caught up in mainstream media? Is what I have been watching really any different?
        </p>

        <p>
            If the average person were to watch the documentary "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cg2VtbRr8qM">SHADOW GOVERNMENT Who Rules America?</a>" they would most likely brush it off as a bunch of incoherent gobbledygook and think I'm crazy to give it even an ounce of credibility.
        </p>

        <p>
            But then, I'll turn around around to the latest news about how the President just made a horrible foreign relations blunder and call IT a bunch of incoherent gobbledygook that's designed to keep the masses entertained, disappointed, and distracted.
        </p>

        <p>
            So, I'm a hypocrite. I fell into the trap that I advise others to avoid.
        </p>

        <p>
            These things it the videos you see above are <em>nice to know</em>. It's nice to know how the world works. It's nice to know some of the psychological techniques used in manipulation. It's nice to know that severe resource shortage may be the driving force behind the next global upheaval.
        </p>

        <p>
           But right now, So what? Who cares? How is worrying about this right now going to affect my life in any way?
        </p>

        <p>
            All that it's doing is making me feel worse about something I have very little control over. I'm just like the person who feels disappointed  after reading about America pulling out of the Paris Accords, or afraid about what might happen with North Korea.
