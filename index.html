    <p id="the-latest"> THE LATEST:</p>

    <div id="come-with-me-on-this-journey">
            
        <p>
            They say that history repeats itself, and that those who forget their history are bound to make the same mistakes over, and over, and over again.
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">
            I agree. You can learn a lot from recorded history, whether it's a textbook, a blog, or your personal notes (listed in order of increasing impactfulness).
        </p>
        
        <p>
            This year I'm going to <em>force</em> history to repeat itself so that you can come along for the ride.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Two years ago, I decided that I didn't want to continue work at the large enterprise software company, and <a href="http://dontdumbbesmart.com/fu/">made it my goal for the year</a> to leave with the ability to have at least three months of freedom before needing to apply to jobs.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            A lot of people have asked how I did it - without even having another job lined up - and a few have replicated my steps to find themselves, sometimes inexplicably, in much better situations because of it.
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">
            So, I thought it would be fun to <em>just do the same thing all over again</em> but write about it so that you can follow along. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            But really, I'm doing this again because there's something that I want out of it. I left the large enterprise software company to work for a small enterprise software company under the guise that it would be more fun, challenging, rewarding, and impactful as told by the many that took the "best step in my life" before I did.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            However, it turns out that after that wonderful new company smell* fades away, it's not so much different than where you were before, unless you personally are very passionate about the work you're doing, in which you're in the right industry.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            So, now that the present time feels similar to a past time, I think it's a fitting time to force a repeat.
            </p>
        
<!--
        <p>
            I'd say that you may want to follow along if any of these things are true about you:
        </p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>You feel like you would like to find a new job soon because your current job is not fun/exciting/your passion/challenging/[your reason] enough anymore.</li>
            <li>You want to take the next step in your career or get a raise, but aren't sure how to do it other than wait for it to come (or get another job)</li>
            <li>You want to know how powerful it feels to have FU money.</li>
            <li>To all the people whos advice you've taken that has proven to be pretty shitty, you want to say <em>"fuck you"</em> in your own subtle way.</li>
        </ol>
-->
        
        <p>
            When I started, I didn't know how much I was spending, saving, or making. When I thought of each one before, it would be a crude approximation based off of the fact that I still had money left in my accounts at any point in time. In any case, there was always savings if needed, so I was all good, you know, just in case I wanted to buy a car.. I was contributing a little bit to my retirement accounts because I had started reading FI blogs earlier in the year and they said it was a good idea. I think I contributed the slightly-above-average amount of 10% of my income to a combination of traditional and roth accounts.
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">
            Heck, I even felt like I had enough money in the middle of 2015 to go buy a new car. (You can read about that <a href="http://dontdumbbesmart.com/my-first-and-last-new-car/">here</a>)
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Anyway, you get the idea. I basically had no idea what I was doing and felt totally helpless with regards to anything money related.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            But if I was going to be able to leave my job and survive comfortably for three months without income, I knew that had to change quickly.
        </p>

        <p>
            And that's the first thing that we're going to have to do in 2018.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I think this time will be a bit more fun because I can focus more on helping you should you choose to follow along. I've already been through the process once before: I know how much I spend each month; I know what having FU money feels like, I know how much I'll need to pay in taxes for this year - all things that took quite a bit of time to figure out.
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">
            So you could say that I'm <em>cheating (oh no, how terrible. I should get expelled)</em> because I have a leg up in this one. But don't let that discourage you.
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-2">
            You know, if you do let it discourage you, you're basically saying you can't do the same thing because you have a lot of 'yes, but...'s you'd rather cycle through and also have no faith in your ability to make things happen in this world.
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">
            But for those of you that do want to take the first step towards freedom: Welcome aboard! It's going to be a hell of a ride. 
        </p>        
    
        <p class="indent-1">

And if you ever get discouraged, send me (or someone) a message instead of letting it eat you up. I'm here to support you on this one, and so are your friends and family (I hope).
        </p>
        
        <p>
            In the time between now and the start of the year, I'll be setting up my accounts so that I'm starting as close to zero as I can. This means emptying my spending accounts, starting fresh on a new budget, and probably some other things I haven't thought about yet. 
        </p>

        <p>
            My list of worries is coming along nicely. Every time I have a worry and remember what I'm supposed to do, I whip out the notepad app on my phone and write down my worry. It's strangely cathartic, because after I write my worry down, it leaves my mind for a time.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            What I have so far:
        </p>
        

        <ul>
            <li>Not having sold my car yet</li>
            <li>The transmission drip leak from the pan</li>
            <li>Moving my mom's car every few days to avoid a street cleaning ticket</li>
            <li>How this work project where I become a contractor is going to work out</li>
            <li>Finding a housemate to rent out the room</li>
            <li>Not getting enough sleep</li>
            <li>Not falling asleep fast enough to get enough sleep</li>
            <li>Not being able to fall asleep without smoking</li>
            <li>Being groggy in the morning from smoking late at night to sleep</li>
            <li>That my friend is going to make a limiting decision that closes doors and removes opportunity needlessly</li>
            <li>That people will think I'm slacking at work</li>
            <li>That people will judge me for smoking</li>
            <li>That I'm going to have a worry and forget to write it down</li>
            <li>That the thing I'm currently doing will lose my focuse and become another unfinished project</li>
            <li>Not waking up on time </li>
            <li>Falling asleep after snoozing my alarm</li>
            <li>Being so tired that I miss my alarm</li>
            <li>That a stock I buy will go down</li>
            <li>WHat time it is in the morning so I don't get up too late and have to rush</li>
            <li>Spending too much on lunch with coworkers one day</li>
            <li>That it's been more than 90 minutes when only the first 90 minutes of parking are free</li>

            If I could, I would buy EFX right now, and continue buying if it continues to drop.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Unfortunately, there is a potential for being flagged with insider trading because of my work. I'm relatively sure that the SEC won't care about a little fish like me, but I don't really want to put their algorithms to the test and have to deal with it if it does become a problem. 
        </p>
        
        <p> 
            Yea, I'm a pussy. Their machine learning can't be that smart...
        </p>

        <p>
            I think the market reaction to the cyber breach is way overblown and is not likely to affect their business in a substantial way.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The consumer is most affected because people may now be able to use your information to open new lines of credit, file a tax return in your name, or commit crimes using your identity.
        </p>

        <p>
            But, Equifax's main customer is not the consumer. The consumer is the product. <em>We are for sale.</em> Their real customers are the companies that want to quickly pull your credit file so they can sell you a financial product. Why do you think it's soooooo complicated and troublesome to contact the credit agencies, when a bank that wants to issue you a credit card can do so INSTANTLY online without notifying you? Why do you think you are only allowed to pull your own credit report once per year? Until a recent law, you had to pay to pull your report.
        </p>

        <p>
            As of my writing this, the stock sits at just above $93, down from $142 just before the news of the breach broke. So much negative press and undue concerns that Equifax is going to tank in earnings is pushing the stock price way down. It might continue to go down from here, sure, but its fundamental business isn't going to be affected in any major way.
        </p>

        <p>
            They're going to go bankrupt! Nobody is going to do business with them anymore! Nobody trusts them anymore! There are two other companies that do exactly the same thing! They're giving away so many products for free!
        </p>

        <p>
            Hmm, where have I heard the exact same news over and over again?
        </p>

        <p>
            But it's all good. We can profit from other people's ignorance.
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">
            That's what I'm doing with the toothpaste industry!
        </p>

        <p>
            I'm sad that I can't (cough am too afraid to) buy, but it's not the end of the world. There will be other huge negative press events that unduly depress a stock price that I can buy into.
        </p> 

        <p>
            For sake of mulling over missed opportunities, let's say I actually did place an order for $10,000 today. I would have been able to buy 107 shares at $93. I'll check back in a year to see where I would have been.
        </p>

        <p>
            I did something like this last year. I bought 50 shares of SPWR at $10.77 last October. It wasn't directly following negative press event - I did it on a whim because I wanted to prove to a friend that a buy-and-hold strategy fairs just as well or better as day trading. Currently, SPWR sits at $7.64. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            My lesson plan isn't going exactly as I had planned. 
        </p>

        <p>
            But in another month, I can sell it and use the losses offset the sale of some long-term gains!

        <p>
            Update: Two weeks later, on 22 Sep 2017, EFX closed at $105, up 13% from my pretend purchase price (when talking about the price of stocks people like to redundantly list the percent change because it sounds like another useful data point)
        </p>

        <p>
            Update 10 Oct: Opened at $113, up 19%. Comparing it to SPWR, which is now at $6.84, down 36% from what I bought it at.
        </p> 

        <p>
            Update 3 Nov 2017: Back down to $108. Still up 16% from where I <em>would have</em> bought it. I also sold SPWR at a substantial loss and bot SNAP instead. Let's see how that turns out in a year.

            Somebody might come to you one day and say,
        </p>

        <p class="indent-1">
            "Hey there, I'd like you to come over to my house everyday. I'd like you to arrive before 9am and stay until 6pm. I won't feed you, but there are some good places where you can grab something quickly if you don't want to bring your own food. 

            <br /> <br />

            I don't have any parking for you but the garage nearby only takes $400/month for a spot. There's a bus stop nearby if that's more convenient.

            <br /> <br />

            I'd like you to sit at this computer and perform various tasks. Some may be needed immediately, others will be project-based over a longer time horizon.

            <br /> <br />

            I'll need you to come in and do this every day. You can stay home if you get sick - a few days a year - and you'll have 3 weeks for yourself to do what you wish. Of course, you'll have to let me know well in advance when you'd like to take a break.

            <br /> <br />

            When you're here, I do expect you to do your best work and put in your top effort. I'll review your performance and give you feedback on how to improve your work. And please be friendly and work together with the others that come in every day."
        </p>

        <p>
            "What the fuck? Why would I agree to do something like that? What's in it for me to come to your place everyday and do what seems like menial tasks in front of a computer? Why would I even spend time coming here to do all these things? Also, I have my own friends"
        </p>

        <p class="indent-1">
            "Well, what if I offered you a decent salary that would allow you to do the things you love on your free time? You can pick up a few hobbies, travel during your 3 week break, buy yourself a car so you don't have to take the bus any longer. What do you say?"
        </p>

        <p>
            "Hmm..."
        </p>

        <p>
            Would you do your job if you didn't get paid for it? 
        </p>

        <p class="indent-1">
                Of course not. Why would anyone do a job if they're not getting paid? That's the point of a job! To get paid! Isn't it?
        </p>

        <p>
            That's the point of your job to you. But not your employer. You're giving your employer something much more valuable - your time and skills - in exchange for a little bit of money. 
        </p>

        <p>
            How do you get someone to do something?

        </p>

        <p>
            The convenience factor that money provides cannot be understated. 
        </p>

        <p>
            And it's only getting more convenient. Nowadays, people get paid with direct deposit by default instead of checks or hard cash. 
        </p>

        <p class="indent-1">
            This means that your employer is able to offer you a certain level of security that the number in the database that your bank keeps on the same row as your account number will be increased by a certain amount on a set interval.
        </p>

        <p class="indent-2">
            But not too much. It has to be <em>just enough</em> that you keep coming back. Just enough so that you keep giving it your all. 
        </p>

        <p class="indent-1">
            Of course, you'll get better and better at doing the work that you do. At some point, you'll want something more challenging and rewarding. So you'll either ask your current employer to give it to you, or you'll go out into the market to advertise your skills and hope that another company will facilitate database transactions with your bank in exchange for your time.
        </p>

        <p class="indent-2">
            But even when you do this, you'll find that it becomes just as before. You'll eventually want something new. 
        </p>

        <p>
            The only way out of the cycle and to <em>really</em> get rich is to do your own thing or<a href="https://www.thefrugalgene.com/dumb-luck-rich/">get lucky</a>. 
        </p>

        <p>
            But chances are, you're not going to be one of the few who win the company lottery (unless you can predict the future, but then you'd already be the richest person alive) so trading your time for someone else's gain is not going to get you where you want to go. But that's just fine, because life is a journey with death as the final destination. 
        </p>

        <p>
            So you can never really <em>make it</em> in life. 
        </p>

        <p class="indent-1">
            Not by getting the next promotion, not by breaking out of the cycle and doing your own thing, not by winning the lottery.

            There will never be enough money in your bank account.

            I worry about the inevitable total indoctrination of the masses because I'm afraid of having to be forcefully indoctrinated against my will. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I had to write my first worry down here because I went off to set up my twitter account and got caught up in an internet wormhole.

        <p class="indent-1">
        	Like, I think I'm going to sign up for a protomail.com email account.

        <p>
            So far I've got:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>I'm worried about not finishing my work because my manager might get mad </li>
            <li>I'm worried about forceful indoctrination</li>
        </ul>     

        <p>
            Well, this list is going pretty well. I have two things on it and a reason for why I shouldn't be worried about either.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The first, I've detailed in an earlier post. The second won't happen for a very long time, probably long after I'm dead, so I should really have zero worry about it. 
        </p>
        
	   <p class="indent-1">
            In between the time it takes to completely indoctrinate a whole group of people, a couple break free, see the light, make a lot of noise and eventually the whole plot fails. I think the millenial generation is too rebellious to become the indoctrinated generation. It might seem like it now, but when shit hits the fan and they realize that living life how they've been told will suck in the long run and the promise of the flowery, 'better-than-my-parents' life of consumption and materialism is not going to happen, we'll do something about it.
           
            <br /> <br />

            Hey, I should know. I'm one of them.

            <br /> <br />
           
            To have a successful total indoctrination, you basically need to have an entire generation grow up such that they don't ever develop the habit of questioning authority on <em>anything</em>. There are currently too many sources from which to pick up this habit. You'd have to have a child grow up completely separated from these sources in a purposefully designed curriculum that never entices them to ask questions.
           
            <br /> <br />

            Oh, how terrible it would be to have been born into an indoctinated generation. Knowing how my mind feels now, I could not imagine never having questioned anything. Life would be dull. There would be an endless supply of instant gratification, as long as you do exactly what you are told. You would own nothing - not even your body.
        </p>

        <p>
            No matter how much it seems that everybody is indoctrinated already, there are those (seemingly growing in size) who are not. I believe that that is going to go on for at least a few more generations.
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>I worry about San Francisco being nuked because of what they've been talking about in the news </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
            Ok, what is this, the Cold War? Who's going to nuke San Francisco? That would be very, very, very bad for business. If anything were to happen, it would probably be on a much smaller scale, like the TT Deal. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Regardless, this is not something that is in my control at all, so I should carry out my life as if it's not going to happen. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Ah, this is sort of me getting caught up in the news like I say everybody else does. The news makes me worry about things, even the news on the other side of mainstream.
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">
            To be perfectly honest, I know that the other side of the news is also written in a way to encourage page views and clicks. Sucks that it has to be that way, but it is. Can't blame them for it though, they gotta make a living.
        </p>

        <p class="indent-1">
            I think the news is a big reason I worry about forceful indoctrination and citizens in San Francisco being attacked by the enemy. 
        </p>

        <p>
            If the news is a source of worry, then what I should do is cut out the news.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I've wanted to tell one of my coworkers to give up the news and because it'll make him happier not worrying about what celebrities are doing to negatively affect foreign policy and the latest name-calling tweet sent out by the USAC CEO.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Well, shit. Time to start eating my own dog food.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            It's not that it's a bad thing to know about though. It has helped a great deal, especially when it comes to understanding something - but it didn't come just from eating what was spoon fed to me. I had to actively seek out materials that was outside of the "what I already think" bucket.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Most people don't know that the United States is a corporation listed in Dun and Bradstreet with jurisdiction to operate only within the District of Columbia. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Is it useful to know that though? Is anything in your life going to change by knowing that? You may feel resentful and less nationalistic pride, but what good does that do?
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">
            It could also very well be a joke. <br /><em>Haha, I registered a company named USA Corp so people would think our country is a corporation!</em>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            In the context of my life, it's similar to knowing what's happened in the last episode of Game of Thrones. 
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">
            Yes, I do know. But so what?
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I think it's good to know for one reason, and that is to realize what life is. I now understand what my old manager meant when he said 
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">
            "You have to build your own business"
        </p>
        
        <p>
            It was confusing when I first heard this because I thought the business was the company's business. As in, you should be focused on building the company's business. I thought building your own business was a bit selfish because it would be a waste of company resources. After all, they're paying you, so shouldn't you be doing all you can do advance the business that pays you so that they can pay you more?
        </p>
        
        <p>
            But that's missing the point. You need to build your own business because you're already assigned a job the minute you become a citizen. You will be kept just content enough that you don't question your job and don't leave or go on strike. Then, when you're no longer needed and tossed aside in a reorg, you're done. But if you build a business within the larger business, then you have the opportunity to flourish within the system.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Plus, as long as the business you build provides something of value, the larger business will depend on the buisness you built. That business will then <em>help you</em> to grow your business by giving you things like tax breaks for each person employed.</p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">
            You can't beat the system, but you can use it to your advantage. 

                <br /><br />
            
            To use the system to your advantage, you first have to realize you're in one. 
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-2">
            Well, I suppose you <em>can</em> beat the system by having enough people riled up to cause a revolution. But the new system that is put in place will have inherent human-nature flaws that can and will be exploited. So you still can't beat the system.
        </p>

        <p>
            It's really hard to get ahead when you're working two full-time jobs, but only getting paid for one. It would be much easier if the job that paid you was part time. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Why do you think the super wealthy pay so little in taxes as a percentage of their income comared to most full-time working Americans?
        </p>
        
        <p>
            They realize the system they are in, understand it very well, and use it to gain an incredible advantage. Just look at how that advantage has played out over the past 40 years:

            In the last post, I linked to a post I had written on DontDumbBeSmart. It's actually becoming a very good example of a project that I start but doesn't end up anywhere because I get too busy, lose motivation, or [insert other reason here].
        </p> 
        
        <p>
            And with most of my time now dedicated to work, it becomes harder to spend long periods of time writing blog posts that I consider good enough. During the little bit of time I'm not at work, I tend to want to kick back and relax or hang out with friends. There's always something that I want to write about in the back of my head though... [foreshadowing alert]
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">
            This is where <em>this</em> site comes into play.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I've set my goal for this year to simplify my life as much as I can. I also detailed that decision in another post I wrote on DDBS.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I wrote that it was really an incredibly vague goal, and I wasn't really sure what it meant or how it would work.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Vague goals are very hard to accomplish because there are no concrete things you can immediately latch onto and the measure of success is subjective.
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">
            'Getting fit' is a vague goal.
            <br /><br />
            'Going to a specific gym M-W-F before work for one hour' is a specific goal. You can immediately do a thing like plan out your morning ritual to make it happen and it's easy to measure it's success.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Last year's goal was specific - it was a number-based goal. All I had to do was to get a number as close to another as possible. That was easy enough to do.
        </p>

        <p>
            The thing I have to do is to translate my vague goal into a specific goal like the one about gettin fit.
        </p>    
        
        <p class="indent-1">
            But the problem is I'm not sure how to translate it.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I'll just try something and see if it makes sense. Can't hurt even if it fails.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I think one way of measuring how simple your life is by the count of things you worry about. If I spend too much time worrying about something, it takes away time from other things that I could be doing. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Plus, it's not healthy. Isn't worry related to stress somehow?
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">
            I should know. I don't feel good when I'm worried.
        </p>    
        
        <p>
            This is what I'll do: I will take note of all the things things that worry me. No matter what it is, big or small, I will record it. After two weeks of record keeping, I will review my worries.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I can retroactively start this list here (although I'm going to use a text editor on my phone for entry on-the-go) from the last post.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Last night's worry was, essentially:<br />
            - I'm worried about not finishing my work because my manager might get mad.
        </p>

        <p>
            I realize that what comes after 'because' is important, becase that provides a starting point for further analysis which could help me rationalize why I shouldn't have that worry. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Everything should go on this list. Every time I have a worry, I need to pick up my phone and write it down. I need to create a new habit loop. Since this is a new habit, it should be easier to form than if it were an existing habit.
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">
            But wait, I already have worries, so this might actually be trying to alter a new habit. In which case, I need to identify and understand my existing habit loop.
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-2">
            Or I could just get started without overthinking the whole thing.
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">
            I can tell that I'm kind of addicted to porn because I thought for a split second that whacking it each time could be a good reward. Not very practical though. Imagine doing that at work...
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The trigger is having a worry. Whenever I have a worry, I need to have myself associate it with a reward. What's a good reward? What can I reward myself with after having just written down a worry, phone in hand? 
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">
            Hmm... What about posting the worry to Twitter? People get gratification when they submit something to the internet. But is it only if they get likes or people retweet? I'll get zero retweets. What if I find it not rewarding and stop? What if...? We can continue down the 'What if' hole a long time
            
        </p>
            
        <p class="indent-2">
            Then I'll just change the reward...
        </p>
    
        <p class="indent-1">      
            I want to think of another reward so I have two options to choose between. 
 
            <br /><br />
            
            Can I motivate myself with money? I could allocate $20 for every worry I write down for something. But It would be my money, and if I were to do anything with it, I could just do it anyway.
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-2">
            Plus, money is a horrible motivator and might motivate me to come up with false worries so I can allocate more to something. And it's hard for me to be objective with my own worries.

            I can do something with emotional state.
 
            <br /><br />
            
            The emotional state I get when I worry will remind me to take out my phone and write down what I'm worried about. After writing it down, I'll feel better about having written it down to deal with it later. That'll be the reward.
 
            <br /><br />
            
            Hmm, I like the idea of posting to Twitter more. It actually results in the emotional state reward as well!

        All right. Time to start a new twitter account, @livingwithoutstuff!

            Let's say I want to go to my company's happy hour, but I promised to send something out by EOD today to a colleague to forward off to a customer. What do I do?
        </p>

        <p>
            I get up and go to my company's happy hour.
        </p>

        <p class="indent-1">
            <em>What.</em>
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">
            <em>You promised a deliverable, you should finish it!</em>
        </p>

        <p>
            I should continue sitting at my desk until I got the thing done, no matter how long it takes? What if everybody leaves by the time I finish?
        </p>

        <p class="indent-1">
            <em>But won't your manager get mad?</em>
        </p>

        <p>
            Maybe, but why should I care if someone at work gets mad at me? What is anyone gonna do? Am I going to get fired? Are they going to hold it against me when we're selling software to big ass enterprise companies that never have their 'automated business workflows' shit together? Are they going to not do business with us because we didn't get an email out on Friday night? 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Let's try to look at it from the recipient's point of view:
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">
            You are manager of information technology at one of the largest companies in the world. You've been at your company anywhere from five to twenty years and you enjoy the work-life balance that your job provides. Your in-office hours are 8:00 to 17:00, and all of your coworkers know this. They know better than to ask you for something important at ten to four on Friday. You have a host of issues to deal with in your day-to-day, but you also have to stay on top of new technologies in your space, so you end up having to talk to a bunch of vendors that are <em>always</em> promising to fix <em>most</em>, but not all, of your problems.
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">    
            Are you going to step away from your Friday night plans to go review what it is some little-but-quickly-growing-startup-with-the-latest-and-greatest-make-the-world-a-better-place-for-real technology company's sales team sent them? 
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">
            Hell no. That's gonna happen on Monday... Maybe Tuesday, or by the end of next week at least.
        </p>

        <p class="indent-1">
            Wait, was a vendor supposed to send me something today?
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Well, I should probably get that out on Sunday before getting in... you know, just so that nobody asks why I didn't finish it...
        </p>
        
        <p>
            So, I think one way to think about this is to start interacting with your customers the way they interact with you. <em>You mirror them</em>. If we miss something, we say "sorry it's taking longer than expected" and just reschedule the meeting or deliverable for another time. People reschedule meetings with people all the time, lol. 
        </p>

        <p class="indent-1">
            "Hey, sorry, realized that this Friday I was gonna be out so can we reschedule that meeting where I was going to come to your office where you have meetings all day every day? Sorry to ruin our relationship, hopefully we can meet next week instead. Thanks"
        </p>

        <p>
            Nothing bad is gonna happen as long as I have <a href="http://dontdumbbesmart.com/fu">FU Money</a>.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            And if it does, so what? I have FU Money!
        </p>
        
        <img src="images/keep_calm_with_fu_money.png"/>
        
        <p>
            I need to follow my advice a bit more. Work is getting to a point where it's becoming more annoying than interesting on a day-to-day basis.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I need to remember the lessons that FU money taught me last year and use them to restore balance to the force.

            At this point I'm too tired to write.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            When I sat in bed, my workstation's battery was 55%. Just before coming upstairs, I had a really strong desire to write. I got distracted with all sorts of different other tasks on the computer and didn't actually start writing this until 25%. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Now if I were to keep writing, it would be forced because my desire to get to sleep outweighs my desire to write.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            So here are a few topics I thought about writing today:

            <li>An interview with a Doctor on the radio full of cognitive dissonance</li>
            <li>Working for time is more efficient than working for money</li>
            <li>Why some people want to control everything</li>
            <li>What does the title of this page have to do with anything?</li>

            Recently I got caught up in something I always advise people not to do: I started watching the news and taking it too seriously.
        </p>

        <p>
            It started because I got really into listening to Frank Zappa's music, which appears innocent and trivial on the surface, but it's really making fun of almost all of society, being so brilliantly deceptive that even the very people that the music calls stupid love it.
        </p>

        <p>
            Then, I tumbled upon "other videos I might like" and some were documentaries of how we're all doomed for one reason or another and only have a few decades left before we all again decline into another worldwide war, this time due to the scarcity of critical resources.
        </p>

        <p>
            <em>Just have a look at my recent youtube history:</em>
        </p>

        <img src="images/a-trip-down-zappa-lane/youtube_history_05_17_1.png"/>

        <p>
            Start off with the normal cruft I listen to, along with some tunes that allow me to reminisce about college.
        </p>

        <p>
            So far, just music.
        </p>

        <img src="images/a-trip-down-zappa-lane/youtube_history_05_17_2.png"/>

        <p>
            Here we see a viewing of a video offering an explanation of Carl Jung's Synchronicity, before returning to the finer works "To All My Niggas" and "Drug Ballard."
        </p>

        <img src="images/a-trip-down-zappa-lane/youtube_history_06_17_1.png" />

        <p>
            I come back to the Youtube after a six week summer break.
        </p>

        <p> 
            During the early part of this time, I read a book called <i>The Power of Habit</i> and decided that I would set out to create a habit for myself.
        </p>

        <p>
            The habit that I wanted to create was a daily routine where I would get up in the morning, have one hour to do my own work, and return home from work at a reasonable hour to get to bed in order to wake up early enough. 
        </p>

        <p>
            I experimented with a spoonful of honey as my reward if I woke up early enough the next morning.
        </p>

        <p>
            This lasted consistently for a duration of about three or four weeks, after which point things would change, get in the way of the habit, and I'd find a lecture called "The Importance of Discipline".
        </p>

        <p>
            <em>Yup, life changed and for whatever reason, I couldn't keep up the habit.</em> Maybe the reward wasn't good enough. Maybe the content of the work wasn't entertaining enough. Maybe I wasn't motivated enough to keep going on whatever I was doing.
        </p>

        <p>
            I think it's the last one.
        </p>

        <p>
            My intention with viewing "The Importance of Discipline" may have been to justify my reasons creating a habit, and look for clues as to how to improve my own discipline. But Youtube drew my attention to other videos I might be interested in, like "What Makes You a Mature Adult" and "How to Stop Overthinking." 
        </p>

        <p>
            Needless to say, it got me.
        </p>

        <img src="images/a-trip-down-zappa-lane/youtube_history_06_17_2.png" />

        <p>
            Whenever I watch John Oliver, I end up feeling depressed about the state of the world, so I would turn to old classics a few days later to help cheer me up.
        </p>

        <p>
            Up next I would revisit the wonderful work of Frank Sinatra, Eminem, and the soundtracks of some of my favorite childhood games - Tony Hawks Pro Skater and Need For Speed (on repeat!) - with day stops back at Alan Watts and Hardstyle livesets every so often.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Here is where its gets interesting:</strong><br />
            A colleague in marketing had sent out a Youtube video in order to internally justify the existence of our product. <em>"This would be a great thing for our customers to understand"</em> he said. The video he sent out is at the top of this next list:
        </p>

        <img src="images/a-trip-down-zappa-lane/youtube_history_07_17_1.png" />

        <p>
            It's a recording of a presentation given by the NSA TAO Chief on how they think about  hacking into and spying on various adversarial groups without being discovered. 
        </p>

        <p>
            One of the suggestions after this video was made by someone doing producer's version voice-over comments of the TAO video, pointing out all the various ways he used deceptive language to say one thing but really mean another - The great irony being that a man is telling an audience exactly how his employer invades their privacy and they still applaud at the end of the speech.
        </p>

        <p>
            This started me down the path that eventually got me to Frank Zappa, and from there, the rest is history (that we'll be reviewing).
        </p>

        <p>
            After watching several we're-all-cyber-doomed-themed videos, I somehow stumbled upon "WHAT TUPAC/FRANK ZAPPA WANTED YOU TO KNOW" after which I felt lost and disgusted in humanity. How could we have gotten to this point where people are just a sheepish mass that are controlled, pushed around, and experimented on without their knowledge or any reprocussion for those pulling the strings? Doesn't anyone care? Deosn't anyone notice? Are peopel so ignoran? Does nobody want to do the right thing for the greater good of society?
        </p>

        <p>
            How awful I must have felt after that. I went back to the Alan Watts lectures a few days later in attempt to find greater meaning and not feel so down about myself. If I could find an explanation of why things are as they are (<em>It's all just human nature at the end of the day</em>) I would feel better about what Tupac and Frank talked about. Maybe.
        </p>

        <p>
            Maybe not. I seem to search upon Trout Mask Replica when things are all crazy and I need to listen to crazy music because everything else just doesn't really help. 
        </p>

        <p>
            It was the first thing that I put on the first day of August. Music by a guy known as Frank Zappa, having himself worked with Captain Beefheart, were in the recommended videos sidebar. An old friend's high regard for his music made me just curious enough to try to find out for myself what made his music so special.
        </p>

        <p>
            I gave it a shot.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I got hooked.
        </p>

        <p>
            For the next month I would consume as much as I could of Frank's music. Every chance I got, I would play it: At work, cooking, playing board games, in the car. It was perfectly designed for my consumption. It "spoke to me."
        </p>

        <p>
            Of course, there would be days where I would put on the standard THPS soundtrack or Hardstyle sets, but I would continue to come back to Zappa.
        </p>

        <a id="zappa-break"></a>

        <p>
            If you'd like to take a break from reading this and constantly listen to Frank Zappa for a month, now would be a good time to give it a try and see how it makes you feel. This post will still be here when you get back. You can bookmark <a href="#zappa-break">this link</a> to come back exactly here. I'm not going to attempt to describe the feeling because experience is the fastest way to understand something.
        </p>

        <p>
            After all was said and done, the topic of videos that I landed on was <em>money</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
            <em>Everything leads back to money.</em>
            Check it out: 
        </p>

        <img src="images/a-trip-down-zappa-lane/youtube_history_09_17_1.png"/>

        <p>
            On the same day I finally grew tired of listening to Zappa all day, I stared watching videos about money.
        </p>

        <p>
            At first, the topics were innocent and widely relatable. The gateway video was an early retirement update from Mike & Lauren who just purchased a warehouse. That lead to a video about how much Americans are screwed for retirement because of a lack of savings and a recent financial downturn (the 2008 one in this case).
        </p>

        <p>
            Following this I watched some videos from BeatTheBush, who offers surprisingly simple and upbeat advice about how to save a lot of money while still being able to drive a sports car to work.
        </p>

        <p>
            And then...
        </p>

        <img src="images/a-trip-down-zappa-lane/youtube_history_overdose.png"/>

        <p>
            Crisis.
        </p>

        <p>
            When will it hit? What should I do? I know that it's coming, should I sell now so I can lock in the gains? Will my 401k be all right? Should I really be in a Roth 401k? Gee, I should think about this some more.
        </p>

        <img src="images/a-trip-down-zappa-lane/youtube_history_401k.png"/>

        <p>
            Oh God, I'm scaring myself about my 401k now. Why have I tried to max it out every year? Is there something better I could have done with it? 60 Minutes ran a peice on why you should <em>NEVER</em> own a 401k! Is it all just another trap? I know they exist. Is this a trap?
        </p>

        <img src="images/a-trip-down-zappa-lane/youtube_history_09_17_2.png"/>

        <p>
            Well, there goes the neighborhood. We're all living in the Matrix. Nothing is real. Everything is a construction. We're all rats running around and around in a cage for someone else's gain until we can't go on and fall over. At the last moment before we croak, we wonder what we spent our only life doing.
        </p>

        <img src="images/a-trip-down-zappa-lane/youtube_history_cage.png"/>

        <p>
            In order to escape from a cage, you must first realize that you are in one.
        </p>

        <img src="images/a-trip-down-zappa-lane/youtube_history_09_17_3.png"/>

        <p>
            I should mention that none of what I was watching was overly shocking to me. I like to think I understand how the world works better than most people. While the way I have been writing may make it seem like I was going through some sort of enlightenment, I was merely watching these videos and thinking to myself <em>"Yup, thought so. Makes total sense. What's wrong with people these days?"</em>
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong style="color: beige">I was consuming content that reaffirmed my already-accepted beliefs.</strong>
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><em>Financial crisis coming again soon?</em> Yup, sure is.</li>
            <li><em>401k vs Roth 401k?</em> Studied it plenty. </li>
            <li><em>The United States of America Limited is a private corporation based in Edinburg?</em> Duh, America is an oligarchy.</li>
            <li><em>Human extinction by 2030?</em> It's a bit overblown maybe, but they make a compelling argument. We are beginning to fight over water...</li>
            <li><em>Drive without a license?</em> Oh, I should look into that. I hate paying DMV license fees...</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            I wasn't really learning anything. Everything I was consuming was just reminding me how fucked up everything is and how helpless I am to do anything about it. Even if I wanted to, there's little I can do to convince <em>enough people</em> to take action to ensure a better future for upcoming generations. That battle is lost, and that makes me feel really sad.</p>

        <p>
            But wait, <strong><em>So what?</em></strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            The elephant in the room here is that I regularly try to explain to people that  they shouldn't get worked up about what they see in the news because all that it's doing is affecting their happiness and outlook on life.
        </p>

        <p>
            So what have I been going through this past few months?
        </p>

        <p>
            How am I any different from the people who get caught up in mainstream media? Is what I have been watching really any different?
        </p>

        <p>
            If the average person were to watch the documentary "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cg2VtbRr8qM">SHADOW GOVERNMENT Who Rules America?</a>" they would most likely brush it off as a bunch of incoherent gobbledygook and think I'm crazy to give it even an ounce of credibility.
        </p>

        <p>
            But then, I'll turn around around to the latest news about how the President just made a horrible foreign relations blunder and call IT a bunch of incoherent gobbledygook that's designed to keep the masses entertained, disappointed, and distracted.
        </p>

        <p>
            So, I'm a hypocrite. I fell into the trap that I advise others to avoid.
        </p>

        <p>
            These things it the videos you see above are <em>nice to know</em>. It's nice to know how the world works. It's nice to know some of the psychological techniques used in manipulation. It's nice to know that severe resource shortage may be the driving force behind the next global upheaval.
        </p>

        <p>
           But right now, So what? Who cares? How is worrying about this right now going to affect my life in any way?
        </p>

        <p>
            All that it's doing is making me feel worse about something I have very little control over. I'm just like the person who feels disappointed  after reading about America pulling out of the Paris Accords, or afraid about what might happen with North Korea.
