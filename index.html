            Predicting when the next recession will hit is a fun pasttime. People try to time the market for all sorts of reasons, from buying low and selling high to gaining credebility to sell product to people later because they were right. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            So here's my completely unfounded, totally random prediction. You should not listen to it, just go about your life as normal.(sup 1) Do not take advice from me or anyone else when making investment decisions without doing your own research first.
        </p>
        
I'm not going to bring any sort of technical analysis into this. Putting numbers to something that is completely based on human sentiment is dumb to me. Half the pople that <em>are</em> looking at technicals say we should already be in a recession, and half say we still have many, many more years of a raging bull.

    Yes, maybe we <em>should</em> be in one already. I can agree with that. But, to the dismay of economists who structure so much data behind their predictions, the markets don't really do what you think they will do. 

    I think one of the main drivers of the market is emotion. If everyone is feeling fearful of the future all at once, markets collapse. The effect that collective human emotion has on the global economy is tremendous. It's not something that you can see with numbers, although economists often try to collect and make sense of such data.

        Perhaps social psychologists would be better at predicting when recessions would hit than economists.

So, just like my investment decisions, my prediction is going to be based on what I think most people believe. I could be very wrong.

<h3>Set the stage</h3>

Numbers show that we should be in a recession? Numbers show that we're in over our head again moreso than the 2008 crash?

    "Eh, fuck that. Things are going well for me. I have a job. I can eat. I just bought a new car. 

    Besides, we're making America great again."

As Mr. Money Mustache points out, we're currently in the <a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2017/06/20/next-recession/" target="_blank">third longest bull market</a> since the end of the second world war. 

The longest one before that was the ten year period leading up to the Dotcom bubble popping. Many people say that today <em>feels just like</em> the early 2000s, when "investors" got excited about how stocks were named.

<img prefix-investing.png>

Today, Silicon Valley is full of entrepreuers trying to make their next million. 

It's also full of young people who are working overtime not for salary, but for a pile of stock options they think will be worth something when their awesome startup company goes IPO.

    Spoiler alert: they'll likely be worthless, or worth very little. Every company can't be a unicorn. Nine out of ten startups fail. Even if your company does have a successful IPO, you better hope that your founders don't stop caring right after they cash out. There have been countless stories of founders cashing out, moving on to starting something else, and leaving the old business to tank. And by the time the employee's lockup period is over, they find out they got sacked.

On top of that, people are going fucking nuts with buying new shit on credit. 

    Malls were full this holiday season. 

    I see new cars in the streets every day now.

    Smart homes are the new craze. With a voice-activated device, you can control your new 4k QLED TV, heater, lights, alarm system, sprinklers, and even turn on off your stove if you forget! (Sup 2)

The party cannot go on. But for now, things are going to be great. They are going to be better than they've ever been before.

Until 2020.

---

If you've been following Trump's efforts to getting his latest job, you'll know how much hard work he must have had to put in to get it.

    <em>He's finally made it.</em>

He's been wanting to get the job as CEO of America for the longest time. He's planned on entering the race many, many times, but has always dropped out because he wasn't absolutely certain that he would win. 

Now that he's in, he's obviously going to want to get promoted to a second term. It would be a total waste to have tried that hard, for that long, and spent all that money to get there and then only serve one term. 

A financial crisis during his first term would not bode well for when he has to reapply for his job.

In order to win again, he needs to keep his supporters happy. Everybody that voted for him this time needs to vote for him in 2020. He needs to make them believe that he's doing good by them. 

That's going to be a very hard thing to do. But it never hurts to try, right?

<h3>Give the people and the companies more money</h3>

Businesses are going to do better because the corporate tax rate is dropping to 21%. This means that earnnings calls for the next several quarters will be good. Stocks will continue to climb.

Most people will pay less taxes in 2018 due to a reshuffling of the lower tax brackets and doubling of the standand deduction. Married couples will have more money.

Removing the state and local tax (SALT) deduction only hurts those in states that have high income tax, like California, Oregon, New York, Minnesota, New Jersey, and Illinois. But, all of those states didn't vote for Trump, so who cares? He doesn't exactly need to make them happy for the next round. 

The lowering of the mortgage interest deduction from $1MM to $750k hurts people who have bought big homes in expensive cities like San Francisco, Seattle, New York, and Chicago - again cities that didn't vote for Trump.

Notice a trend here?

Yea. The states that voted for Clinton will continue to feel screwed over for the next seven (sup 3) years because they're helping to fund the tax cuts. 

The year after Trump leaves office, several benefits of the tax code will expire.

The Bush tax cuts were introduced in 2001 and set to expire in 2010, two years after the 2008 crash and election. Obama "inherited" a mess and oversaw a tremendous bull market. 

    But there's a large subset of Americans who have said they haven't been able to participate in the boom. Most of these people are those that voted for Trump in 2016 becaus they felt disonnant when politicians kept saying how much they have been doing for the people. 

People are saying that all the indicators for a recession are here, but I think there's still a few years left for that very reason.

It's not going to do Trump any good to have a crash in his first term if he wants to get his job back. If people start losing their jobs in pro-Trump states, it's going to be difficult for Trump to claim success because the people he's talking about will know it's not true. Even though presidents have little, or zero effect on the economy, it behooves those that do pull the economic levers to work with the person in charge of the largest military in the world. 

The longer the time since the last recession, the longer people have to get comfortable, and the more people will inflate their lifestyles, buy  houses, cars, smart devices, and other things they can't afford, <em>the more people will be poorer after the next recession comes and goes.</em>

    Plus, the more people you can get to participate and splurge in the good times, the more people that will fall flat on their face when you yank the rug to create bad times.

The gutting of the middle class is far from over.

    But it won't happen during Trump's first term. Or maybe even his second term. I'm sure that as much as Trump wants to keep his job, he wants to leave with a good taste in his supporter's mouths. He is a very brand-driven person, after all.

    In addition to the individual and corporate tax cuts, there are several other things that have happened, like the renegotiation of trade deals and regulation cutting that will help the bottom line of big corporations and small businesses.
    
    Also, just about half of Americans do not invest in the market, down from 62% before 2008,(sup 4) so a lot of people won't exactly care if the market crashes bigly. 
    
So, there you have it: my incredible unfounded and ridiculous prediction for when the next recession will hit. 

    Don't pay any attention to it. I wont.

What should you do about it?

    Nothing.

        I mean it.

If I'm right and we do have at least three years left of the good times, go about your life as usual and make yourself prepared for the bad. Now is a great time to build FU money, take risks, and find answers to the question "what should I do with my life?"

If you're around my age, you've probably never experienced a recession before. The only thing I remember about the 2008 recession was my dad sitting in front of the TV when we were on vacation saying <em>"Oh my god. Markets are getting crushed. This is not good."</em> I didn't understand what was going on or why. They were just numbers on a screen.

I know that my strategy , but will I stick to it? What about when everybody around me - even those who so confidently talk about their resilience to downturns today - starts taking money out of their portfolios? 

    I'm pretty convinced it's going to be a <em>really fucking scary</em> time. People talk about 2008 like it was the worst time ever.

But nonetheless, I'm excited for it to come. I want to see what happens. I want to see what people do. I want to see what the world does.

No matter what happens, it's going to be a hell of a ride.

Official recession start prediction: 2020. After the next election. The people that want to beat Trump will need good markets so they can say that at least something is still going well from their last term, and there may still be a chance to save it. That'll support the narrative of a crash afterwards if Trump does win. 

But, there will be a significant correction sooner than that, certainly involving the technology sector. 

Happy investing!

1. Unless you have more than six months of living expenses in your bank account. If that's you, go get it now while the bull is running.

2. Each set sold separately. (America's favorite marketing catchphrase)

3. Yup, I'm also predicting that Trump gets elected a second time.
