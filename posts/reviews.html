        Here's my philosophy on books:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>If you think you know something, pick up a book on that thing and see what happens. If you disagree with it, try to figure out why the author holds that veiwpoint. It helps to build critical thinking skills. Useful to get it this way because it's <a href="older-posts.html#mistakes-were-made">not taught in our schools</a>. </li>
        <li>If a book looks interesting, get it. The cost of the book is way less than the value of the insights you will receive from reading it. Even if it sucks. If you're worried about the cost of a book, you're always going to be worried about the cost of a book. If you buy a book and never read it, that's worth it too.</li>
        <li>Someone doesn't wake up on day and write a book just to write a book. (If they did, it would suck) Someone writes a book because she feels that she has something so valuable that they just need to share it with the world, and one of the best ways to do that in today's world is to consolidate their thoughts into a compact collection of pages.</li>
        <li>You don't have to read the entire book from end-to-end. If you get the point halfway through, you can put it down. There's no book police.</li>
    </ul>

            Well, it turns out that everything that I was taught about drugs growing up is wrong. The drug war, the dangers of drugs, prohibition, meth, cocaine, weed - it was all a big sham. Just like anything else I thought I knew.
