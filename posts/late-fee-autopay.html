        <p>
            Today, I was charged a late fee on my AmEx credit card.
        </p>
        
        <div class="caption">

        <p>
            An old version of me, the version of my that died recently, would react to this negatively. I'd feel like all sort of a failure.
        </p>
        
        - One way of reacting is to get all negative about it
        - Another way of reacting is to not react at all, but take it as a sign of something needing to be fixed.
        - 14 credit cards, autopay not set up.
        - After getting the late fee, I took 20 minutes to set up autopay on all of my credit cards. 
        - Why didn't I have it set up with 14 cards?
            - Whenever I got a card, I'd set the billing statement to end somewhere between the 5th and 12th of every month. 
            - Every month on the 15th, I'd go in and pay my cards. 
            - The most recent card I got had a different closing date, so it was outside of the normal cycle. 
        - Setting up autopay cuts out (1) Having to change the statement date (2) Avoids late fees
        - It's not worth it for me to call up AmEx, spend 20 minutes on the phone trying to get a refund. I'd rather spend the time solving the problem from happening again, and writing about it to convince you to set up autopay on all of your credit cards. 
        - Just do it. Learn from my mistake
