    Have you ever wondered where all the money from your last paycheck went?
    
    Calculating how much you actually make help you figure that out.
    
    <p>
        Back when I was working at the large enterprise software company, I thought it would be fun to do an analysis of how much I was actually making, after factoring in the overhead of working, like commuting, food, and time. Opportunity cost is an even bigger one that I don't even know how to consider.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Here's what I found:
    </p>
    
    <div class="caption">
        <img src="images/actual-hourly-rate/commuting-to-job.jpg">
        Hmm, that sucks
    </div>
    
    <p>
        I did this exercise to help myself justify switching jobs from one that had a 25-mile one-way commute attached to it to one that I could ride my bike to.
    </p> 
    
    <p>
        Having a drive commute was one of the main reasons I decided to <a target="_blank" href="http://dontdumbbesmart.com/my-first-and-last-new-car/">buy a new car</a> in 2015. I went on a walk with a friend today and told him that I wish I would have kept my old, trusty, 300k mile LS400 because it would have been a much better finincial decision. About a year ago, he was considering buying a $32,000 Audi A4 right after his roommate bought a new Subaru. Even after you're out of school, you can still become a victim of peer pressure.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        When I did this exercise two years ago, I assumed that I would make the exact same amount at my new job, but would not be spending money on commuting or workday lunches, a typical perk at most small software companies in San Francisco.
    </p>
    
    <div class="caption">
        <img src="images/actual-hourly-rate/biking-to-job.jpg">
        A little better
    </div>
    
    <p>
        Now, after being at my job at the small enterprise software company for a year and a half, I think it's high time to do the exercise again, especially since I'm pretty fed up with my situation once again, so I feel that a change is in order. I think it's always a good idea to establish a "business-as-usual" baseline before making a change, so you can make sure that after the change, you will actually come out better off.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        But it doesn't have to just be about money, and the criteria is subjective. You may be at a point where you want to get more time, so you cut your hours or switch to a less-demanding job.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Before we do that, let's take a quick look at the methodology I used two years ago to figure out how much more I would actually take home just from deleting my car commute.
    </p>
    
    
    <h2>Commuting is more expensive than you think</h2>
    
    
    <p>
        Before I could even begin to measure how much I was actually putting in my pocket, I had to know how much I was spending </p>
    
    <h2>The best business is one that makes a profit</h2>
    
    <p>
        Think of yourself as a business. You are the CEO, middle management, and the individual contributor. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The CEO in you decides where you want be and sets the vision for your future.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The middle management in you takes that vision, and decides, without doing it, what work needs to be done to get there. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The individual contributor goes out and does all of the bitchwork that needs to be done to get you there.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        There are costs associated with the work that you need to do as an individual contributor.
