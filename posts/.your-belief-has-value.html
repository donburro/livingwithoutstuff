            You might be wondering why I <a href="colgreat.html">own so much Colgate stock</a> when I don't even buy toothpaste from them. Or anyone for that matter.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Doesn't that go against one of the top rules of investing: only buy stock in companies whose products you like and believe in?
        </p>
        
        <p class="i-1">
            Yes.
        </p>

        
       <p>
            But it's not about what I beleive or encourage others to believe that matters. It only matters what most people believe. 
        </p>

        <p>
            I will never use toothpaste again. But as long as most people continue to believe that toothpaste is required for healthy teeth, it will sell, and I will continue to profit off of their ignorance. 
        </p>
        
        <p class="i-1">
            And their medical bills. Most insurance companies pay dividends, too.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            My dividend is safe as long as they don't get it. 
        </p>

        <p>
            My dividend is safe as long as they keep putting so much trust into "expert" authority figures that advise them to use toothpaste.
        </p>

        <h2>Not just toothpaste</h2>
        
        <p>
            There are many other companies in my portfolio whose products I would never recommend you to use. In fact, I believe that a great deal of them cause more harm than they do good. 
        </p> 

        <p class="i-1, quote">
            WTF? Why would you support companies like that?
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I'm in the stock market to make money, not to save the world. To be fair, I tell people all the time what I have learned, and why I don't use things like toothpaste, but most people don't listen to me. They would rather listen to their dentists. 
        </p>
        
        <p class="i-1">
            Can't blame them for that, though. I am certainly not a dentist.

            In 2012, I stumbled across NVAX, a company that "creates tomorrow's vaccines today," and put it on my watch list.
        </p>

        </div>
        
        <p>
            It piqued my interested because there was a lot of news around Avian Flu spreading fast in Asian countries, and these guys were developing a vaccine for it. 
        </p>
        
<!--
        <p>
            I pointed out the NVAX would do really well. Following my prediction, the stock quadrupled in price the following year because news of an [virus] broke out for which they were developing a vaccine. There was a lot of hype around their product that increased its valuation.
        </p>
-->
        
        <p>
            Twice before, NVAX seemed to have reacted to news of large outbreaks of the flu. Lo and behold, when news about it started to pick up again, Novavax was planning to release a vaccine for it.

           I was making this prediction based only on how I thought people would react to the news about Avian Flu.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I mean, check out some of these headlines. Sounds kinda scary, right?

            But if you ask me to take the vaccine, I would never do it. I would never buy one.
        </p> 

        <p>
            Merck has done wonderfully as well. What they did was ingenious. They came out with a product and have been slowly increasing the market size by influencing public health recommendations. 
        </p>

        <h2>Gardasil</h2>
        
        <p>
            When they first introduced Gardasil, their target market was limited to young or adolescent girls that were starting to become sexually active. Today, public health officials recommend that <em>both</em> girls and boys get the vaccine at birth. This increased the prospects for Gardasil many times over, and increased the conversion rate by administering the vaccine when parents are just beginning to learn the meaning of "anything to keep my baby healthy."
        </p>

        I love the strategy they used because it's a pure marketing play that gets inside the minds of their customers and speaks directly to their greatest fear at the moment. What parent would decline the treatment when told that their newborn child might die? 

        Huge kudos to their strategy and marketing teams. 

        Great product, too.

        But I will never get it. My son, or daughter for that matter, will not get it. 

        But I <em>will</em> continue to buy Merck stock. 

        Because it does not matter what I believe. I'm just one person. 

            It matters what my neighbor believes. 

            It matters what my friends and colleagues believe.

            It matters what you believe.

        It's not what I believe that will keep sales of Gardasil strong. I'm just one of the guys collecting a dividend. 

        The only problem I might face is that if it's administration becomes a legal requirement, it might be an expensive ordeal to get out of it, so I do feel the need to prepare for that. 

            I need my version of ultimate FU money.

        But first, I need a short-term type of FU money - the type designed to get me to the next step in life. 

        I'm actually in the process of getting it and you can follow my journey here (link).

        If you're interested in getting to your own version of FU money, you can follow the steps I'm laying out here (same link).
