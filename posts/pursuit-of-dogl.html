        Let us pretend that the world is populated with exactly ten people, and each of these people have a certain <em>Degree of Good Life</em>. A person's DoGL can go up or down, depending on the quality of their life.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Here are the rules:
    </p>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Each person starts off with the same DoGL</li>
        <li>Mutual agreements can only be made with people directly next to each other. However, each person can interact with any other person. Actions they take may influence DoGL. </li>
        <li>DoGL changes can be both subjective and objective. Even the smallest change in a life circumstance can cause DoGL to change</li>
        <li>DoGL is infinite</li>
    </ol>
        
    <p>
        To start, everybody's DoGL is the same
    </p>
    
    <div class="caption">

    <p>
        We'll represent the world's average DoGL level with a drawn line.
    </p>

        One very effective way of improving your life, as we know, is to improve the lives of other people, because it is a human trait to help people that help you. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        If we take our original example from an earlier post on the basis of society, person 8 finds that person 9, though extremely talented at getting food, is exceedingly bad at preparing food, and therefore wastes a lot of it. 
    </p>
    
    <p> 
        Person 8, however, loves preparing food, and so proposes that they enter an agreement where person 9 will provide enough food for the both of them, and person 8 will ensure that it is always prepared wonderfully. Person 9, excited about the prospect of never having to prepare food again, gleefully agrees.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The DoGLs of both people increases due to their beneficial arrangement. Plus, they each have a new friend to share meals with.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Our chart now looks like this. We will keep old average values to track DoGL progression.
    </p>
    
    
    <div class="caption">
        <img width="500px" src="images/dogl/phase1.png">
    </div>
    
    <p>
        Person 7 sees that person 8 is preparing quite a bit of food these days, and offers to help in exchange for being well fed.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        There is an abundance of food now that person 9 does not have to cook. Person 9, finding that person 10 is quite a nice fellow, asks him to come along while he collects food, teaching him how to gather food. In return, person 9 gets companionship. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        At the same time, over on the left-hand side, person 3 and 4 find a small way to help each other out.
    </p>
    
    <div class="caption">
        <img width="500px" src="images/dogl/phase2.png">
    </div>
    
    <p>
        We end year two with DoGL levels looking like this:
    </p>
    
    <div class="caption">
        <img width="500px" src="images/dogl/phase2_avg.png">
    </div>
    
    <p> 
        If each person continues to find new ways to help the person next to them out, everybody's DoGL will continue to rise. We could even get to the point where everybody's DoGL is the same again.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        I'd call this <em>an increase in humanity's potential</em>. Everybody has worked with each other - both directly and indirectly - to improve the collective DoGL. 
    </p>
    
    <div class="caption">
        <img width="500px" src="images/dogl/phase8_avg.png">
    </div>
    
    <p>
        In fact, progressing this way is going to be the most efficient way to progress, because everybody is satisfied with the amount of DoGL they have. No one has much more, so there's no need to be jealous, and no one has much less, so no need to be protective.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        But let's keep going to see what may happen.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Persons 8-10 control the food production that persons 1-6 depend on. Person 7 is also responsible for food preparation, but does not have the direct relationship with person 9, who <em>gets</em> the food.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Persons 8-10 come to realize that because they are providing one of the necessities of life, they are largely responsible for the total increase in DoGL enjoyed by all ten people. Because of this, and perhaps a crude remark from person 6 that was not taken in good fun, they begin to desire that their DoGL be greater than everyone elses.
    
    </p>
    
    <p class="indent-1">
        After all, if they stop providing food, everybody's DoGL will go down.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        So they start putting demands on the rest of the people. The demands are administered by person 8 through person 7, and because of this, person 7 is promised an above average DoGL, but not a DoGL as high as persons 8-10. 
    </p>
    
    <p class="indent-1">
        It may now be fitting to call persons 8, 9, and 10 the <em>elite</em>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        After all, if it weren't for the generosity of the elite, person 7 would not have had the opportunity to get involved in the food industry.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        What we end up with after twenty years is something like this:
    </p>
    
    <div class="caption">
        <img width="500px" src="images/dogl/phase20_avg.png">
    </div>
    
    <p>
        Now, another thing about us is that we are jealous, envious beings. If we look at someone and see that they have a better life than we do, we yearn for that life. The bigger the difference in our DoGLs, the more we yearn. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Eventually, that yearning can turn to hatred.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        We start saying things like, 
        <em>"why am I down here suffering like this when they are up there?"</em>, <em>"That's not fair"</em>, and <em>"I demand equality!"</em>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        When multiple people feel the same way, the collective voices become chants of unrest.
    </p>
    
    <p class="indent-1">
        <em>"We demand equality! We demand fairness!"</em>
    </p>
    
    <p class="indent-2">
        <em>"Down with the elite!!"</em>
    </p>
    
    <div class="caption">
        <img width="500px" src="images/dogl/phase20_unrest.png">
    </div>
    
    <p>
        Persons 1-6, tired of being left behind while only a "select few" are able to live life to its fullest, take to the streets in protest. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        As unrest grows, the elite begin to realize that they were too greedy. They tried to take too much, too fast, without giving back to the rest. 
    </p>
    
    <p class="indent-1">
        And now they've turned against them.
    </p>
    
    <p class="indent-2">
        And they're outnumbered.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        They start to beg for forgiveness, for mercy, but the masses have had enough. 
    </p>
    
    <p class="indent-1">
        The masses are out for blood.
    </p>
    
    <p class="indent-2">
        Person 4 goes in first. He gets a massive blow on the side of the head that sends the last bit of pain he'll ever feel down his spine.
    </p>
    
    <p class="indent-3">
        Others follow and finish the raid.
    </p>
    
    
    <div class="caption">
        <img width="500px" src="images/dogl/phase21.png">
    </div>
    
    <p>
        And what's left is not a pretty picture. Years of progress wiped away in a single fit of collective rage. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The DoGL average drops for the first time in history. Those remaining have to pick up the peices and continue on. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        DoGL is greatly decreased. But at least the greedy bastards are gone so we won't be suppressed any more.
    </p>
    
    <hr>
    
    <p> 
        There are many different ways DoGL can be measured. You could say that the more wealthy you are, the more DoGL you have. You could equate the number of options you have, or the amount of free time you have in your life to DoGL.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        A higher DoGL is what we are all looking for. We all want to increase our DoGL.
