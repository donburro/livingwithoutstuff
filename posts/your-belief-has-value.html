        It's not about what I beleive or want you to believe that matters. It only matters what YOU believe.

        I would never use toothpaste again. But as long as people continue to believe in the requirement of toothpaste for healthy teeth, it will sell, and I will continue to profit off of your ignorance. 

        My dividend is safe as long as the charade endures. 

            Good thing people put so much trust into authority these days.

        There are other industries in my portfolio that I benefit from financially whose products I would never use. 

        In 2012, I pointed out the NVAX would do really well. Following my prediction, the stock quadrupled in price the following year because news of an [virus] broke out for which they were developing a vaccine. There was a lot of hype around their product that increased its valuation.

            But if you ask me to take the vaccine, I would never do it. I would never buy one. 

        Merck has done wonderfully as well. They have done something ingenious - they came out with a product and have been slowly increasing the market size by influencing public health recommendations. 

            When they first introduced Gardasil, their target market was limited to young or adolescent girls that were starting to become sexually active. Today, public health officials recommend that girls AND boys get the vaccine at birth. This increased the prospects for Gardasil many times over, and increased the conversion rate by administering the vaccine when parents are just beginning to learn the meaning of "anything to keep my baby healthy."

        I love the strategy they used because it's a pure marketing play that gets inside the minds of their customers and speaks directly to their greatest fear at the moment. What parent would decline the treatment when told that their newborn child might die? 

        Huge kudos to their strategy and marketing teams. 

        Great product, too.

        But I will never get it. My son, or daughter for that matter, will not get it. 

        But I <em>will</em> continue to buy Merck stock. 

        Because it does not matter what I believe. I'm just one person. 

            It matters what my neighbor believes. 

            It matters what my friends and colleagues believe.

            It matters what you believe.

        It's not what I believe that will keep sales of Gardasil strong. I'm just one of the guys collecting a dividend. 

        The only problem I might face is that if it's administration becomes a legal requirement, it might be an expensive ordeal to get out of it, so I do feel the need to prepare for that. 

            I need my version of ultimate FU money.

        But first, I need a short-term type of FU money - the type designed to get me to the next step in life. 

        I'm actually in the process of getting it and you can follow my journey here (link).

        If you're interested in getting to your own version of FU money, you can follow the steps I'm laying out here (same link).
