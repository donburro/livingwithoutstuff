        <p>
            Today we walk by homeless in the streets without remorse. We feel bad they have no place to go, but we have no true desire to help.
        </p>
    
        <p class="indent-1">
                If we do give, we often do so out of our own selfishness. We don't stop to talk, to ask, to be empathetic with those down on their luck.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            We give to charities that claim to solve the problem of hunger and disease halfway across the world.
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">
                When we learn that most of these charities give very little towards their advertised cause, we ignore it because we want to <em>feel</em> good more than we want to <em>do</em> good. 
        </p>

        <p>
            But in Future, there will be no homeless. There will be no charities. 
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">
                And it is because everyone will be well fed, healthy, and wealthy. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            There will be no pollution or environmental problems like climate change. 
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">
                Transport, homes, industry - 100% run on energy that cooperates and completents the natural forces. 
        </p>
        
        <p> 
            There would be need for sick days or hospitals.
        </p>

        <p class="indent-1">
                Before you even get sick, you will have been already diagnosed and cured. Major procedures like birth and the occasional amputation will be provided as an in-home service, and be surprisingly painless.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            There will be no war.
        </p>

        <p class="indent-1">
                The countries of the world will have united under the mission of furthering humanity. 
        </p>

        <p>
            <em>But who would do the work?</em> You ask. <em>If everyone got everything they wanted, why would anyone choose to work?</em>
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">
                Well, there may be someone who's passion it is to give birth and provide amputation. People do that now, don't they? They will continue to do so. Everybody will love what they do, and what they do will provide immense value to those around them.
        </p>

            You could go on vacation to Mars and to the Moon. You'll have to wear a spacesuit of course, but you'll be able to make that a weekend trip. 
        </p>

        <p>
                You would be able to live life exactly the way you imagine it. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            And all of us will live happily on our little planet called Earth. 
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">
                All 670 million of us.
        </p>

        <p>
            Oh, but times were not always good. 
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">
                Before Future, there were hard times...
