            They want you to have a better life than they had. That's why they went through all of that trouble and hardship. It was for you. You will carry on their legacy.

            Pretend that there are ten people on Earth, each with a certain Degree of Good Life (DoGL). DoGL measures how good a person's life is. It is the combination of health, relationships, money, freedom - all things that determine how good a life is. Each person's DoGL can go up or down. In the beginning, everybody has the same DoGL.

        <h2>Year 1</h2>
        
        <p>
            In our society of ten, we find that Penine (Person 9) enjoys a specialization in food acquistion. Penine loves to hunt and gather, but ends up wasting a lot of food because Penine has terrible food preparation skills. Penine is not very keen on improving because food is plentiful and it's not something he enjoys.
        </p>

        <p> 
            Peight, taking notice of this, proposes a partnership. Peight likes to prepare food, but only hunts out of necessity. Penine will gather food enough for both of them, and Peight will prepare meals more delicious  than Penine has ever known. Peight and Penine agree to work together.
            
<!--            however, loves preparing food, and so proposes that they enter an agreement where person 9 will provide enough food for the both of them, and person 8 will ensure that it is always prepared wonderfully. Person 9, excited about the prospect of never having to prepare food again, gleefully agrees.-->
        </p>

        <p>
            Peight is glad to not have to hunt, an Penine is relieved to not have to cook.

        <p>
            Peight has always wanted to learn how to craft, but has never found the time because he was just so bad at hunting. 
        </p>
        
        <p class="i-1">
            One day, Peight encounters Pseven (silent P) collecting berries into a masterfully crafted basket and asks if she can teach him how to craft. In exchange, Peight will provide Pseven food. A basket will also help Penine bring home more food. Pseven agrees.
        </p>

            Person 7 sees that person 8 is preparing quite a bit of food these days, and offers to help in exchange for being well fed.

        <p>
            While out on a hunt, Penine overhears someone practicing his comedy routine. He starts laughing because of how funny it is, and invites the young man, Russel Petens, to dine with them.
        </p>
        
        <p class="i-1">
            Since Pseven, Peight, and Penine have been working together, there is an abundance of food, and each is willing to provide for Russel as long as he continues to entertain them. This is very good for Russel, because he sucks at hunting, cooking, crafting - it is a real miracle that he has managed to survive as long as he has.

<!--
        <p>
            There is an abundance of food now that person 9 does not have to cook. Person 9, finding that person 10 is quite a nice fellow, asks him to come along while he collects food, teaching him how to gather food. In return, person 9 gets companionship.

            Somewhere else, Pethree taught Pefour how to tie his shoelaces so he wouldn't constantly trip. Pefour was so thankful that he gave Pethree his favorite book. Pethree learned a little something from it.</p>

            Pesix has a knack for taming wild animals, and Petwo excels at construction, which helps food production because livestock is easier to catch.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Pefive is very creative and produces blueprints for Petwo to build better infrastructure for everybody.

            As Peone through Russel continue to find new ways to help each other, their DoGLs continue to rise.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            After eight years, everyone's DoGL has reached exactly the same level. But this level is over twice as high as it was just eight years ago.

            Amazing!

<!--
        <p> 
            If each person continues to find new ways to help the person next to them out, everybody's DoGL will continue to rise. We could even get to the point where everybody's DoGL is the same again.

            I'd call this an increase in humanity's potential. Everybody has worked with each other - both directly and indirectly - to improve the collective DoGL. 
        </p>

        <p>
            In fact, I believe progressing this way is the best way to progress, because everybody is satisfied with the amount of DoGL that they and - maybe even more important - everyone else has. No one has much more than they do, so there's no need to be jealous No one has much less, so no need to be protective.

        <h2>As time goes by</h2>
        
        <p>
            Peight and Penine start to feel that they deserve more.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            After all, they do supply the food. Everybody needs food. If they were to stop supplying food, everybody's DoGL would decrease dramatically as they would have to go back to supplying their own food.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            In a way, it was their partnership that enabled the rapid increase in DoGL enjoyed by all.

            They started it.

            After all, they do supply the food...
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Peight and Penine make a new agreement. The agree that because they control the means of (food) production, they should have a higher DoGL than all those benefitting from their work.
        </p>
        
        <p class="i-1">
            Except Russel. He's such a funny guy, and they don't want to lose the entertainment.

        <p>
            They tell Pseven, who has developed the infrustructure for food delivery to the masses, that times are tough and that more resources are needed in order to keep up with feeding everybody. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Pseven delivers the news to the people on his next food delivery. They are afraid that food may run low, and agree to help in any way that they can. Besides, they have no reason to doubt Peight and Penine. They get together and devise a plan. 
        </p>
        
       
        <p class="i-1">
            Peone agrees to take on the duties of his friends - in addition to his own - as they work overtime to keep the food supply stable. </p>
        
        <p class="i-1">
            Pefour begins reading up on how to be more efficient in farming, hunting, taming animals, and construction. He serves as an advisor to Pefive, Petwo, and Pesix.</p>
        
        <p class="i-1">
            Pefive draws up plans for a magnificent facility that is capable of producing food up the ying yang.
        </p>
        
        <p class="i-1">
            Petwo gets it built on time and under budget. </p>
        
        <p class="i-1">
            Pesix helps to domesticate several new species of animal. He even learned from Pefour that crops can be crossbred to have more desirable traits, such as size. 
        </p>
        
        <p class="i-1">
            Pethree, now a master of operations, increases the efficiency of all aspects of food production so that the task now requires less time, but provides much, much more.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            After several years of toil, the new food production system is up and running. Peight and Penine thank everyone for their sacrifice, and that because of their hard work, there will likely be no food shortages in the coming years.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Peight and Penine, their jobs now almost completely automated, sit back and enjoy they fruits of their comrades' labor. And Russel's jokes, of course.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            How great a DoGL they now have. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Pseven, who frequents the facility to pick up food, overhears Russel making a joke about the small mindedness of the masses. Penine and Peight erupt in laughter. Intrigued, he creeps closer to get a better listen. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            As the laughter subsides, Pseven overhears:
        </p>
        
        <p class="quote">
            Can you believe they fell for it? They gave up so much of their lives because they thought the food was running short. We didn't even have to feig a shortage. They willingly helped us reach this elite status! Hahahaha
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Flabbergasted, Pseven storms in and confronts the triad. He threatens to tell everybody what they did. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The triad can't have that happen. If the masses found out about the deception, they would revolt. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            They make another deal. The triad agrees to elevate Pseven's DoGL as long as he can keep a secret.  
        </p>

            Persons 8-10 control the food production that persons 1-6 depend on. Person 7 is also responsible for food preparation, but does not have the direct relationship with person 9, who <em>gets</em> the food.
        </p>

        <p>
            Persons 8-10 come to realize that because they are providing one of the necessities of life, they are largely responsible for the total increase in DoGL enjoyed by all ten people. Because of this, and perhaps a crude remark from person 6 that was not taken in good fun, they begin to desire that their DoGL be greater than everyone elses.

            So they start putting demands on the rest of the people. The demands are administered by person 8 through person 7, and because of this, person 7 is promised an above average DoGL, but not a DoGL as high as persons 8-10. 
        </p>

        <p class="indent-1">
            It may now be fitting to call persons 8, 9, and 10 the <em>elite</em>.

            The DoGL average drops for the first time in history. Those remaining have to pick up the peices and continue on.

            There are many different ways DoGL can be measured. You could say that the more wealthy you are, the more DoGL you have. You could equate the number of options you have, or the amount of free time you have in your life to DoGL.
