    <!-- The above to be consistent on every page -->

    <p>
        So, you want to get into current events, do you?
    </p>
    
    <p>
        I know exactly how you feel. I've been there: feeling like I don't know enough about what's going on in the world to keep up with the conversations going on all around me.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        My dad would say, "hey, Don, you're never going to get anywhere in life if you can't talk in a sophisticated manner about current events. At least start watching CNN. You should also use my wall street journal login."
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Then I would try to get into it. I'd bookmark a few links, find a few new things to read about that were interesting. But there was a problem.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        I never knew where to stop. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        There were articles after articles on all sorts of topics happening all over the place. Once I was done reading one, there were another ten links to follow, some even before the article was finished.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        It was endless. 
    </p>
    
    <p class="indent-1">
        Plus, I never knew what the next trending topic was going to be, so I just kept trying to read about as many things as I could.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        But the thing is, I never really liked watching, reading, or listening to the news. 
    </p>
    
    <p class="indent-1">
        It sucked.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        It was all very similar. As I read more and more, I seemed to agree with the articles. Or perhaps, the articles were agreeing with me. They were agreeing with what I was already thinking. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        
    </p>
    

    <div class="quote">
        <p>
            Why do I have to spend my time consuming this shit? Just to be able to talk about it?
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I already know this stuff is going on,  what's the point of reading more about the same?
        </p>
        
        <p>
            If I keep going, I'll just keep learning the same lesson over and over and over again under the illusion of many lessons.
        </p>
    </div>
    
            
    <p>
        But what kept it interesting was that there was a whole group of people that had the completely opposite opinion. They thought I was crazy, and I thought they were just not getting the right information. 
    </p>
    
    <p class="indent-1">
        I knew fat and cholesterol were good for you. Others knew it clogged your arteries.
    </p>
    
    <!--    Here I make a pledge that, instead of empasizing words with HTML attributes, I will build the sentence such that it reads naturally with the emphasis at the desired points -->
    
    <p class="indent-1">
        Others knew that the man who shot &#74&#70&#75 was acting alone. I knew there were several shooters, possibly one in a sewer drain. 
    </p>
    
    <p class="indent-1">
        I knew that the Earth was round. Others <a href="http://www.atlanteanconspiracy.com/2015/08/200-proofs-earth-is-not-spinning-ball.html" target="_blank">knew it was flat</a>. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        And there would be no ending to feeling bad for people because they weren't getting the right information or understanding the problem properly.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        And as much as you might try, they'll never get it right. They'll never listen. 
    </p>
    
    <p class="indent-1">
        They'll never learn the truth.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        And now it's gone a step further - we are quick to criticize people for the opinions they hold, while having enough cannon fodder in case they have done their proper reading of their (wrong) side of the news.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        But, the thing I had been failing to understand was that there is no universal truth, only individual truth. We act in the manner that corresponds to the truths we have created.
    </p>
    
    <p class="indent-1">
        While it is the truth to so many around me that fat and cholesterol clog your arteries, it is my truth that 
    </p>
    
    <p class="indent-1">
        While I believe the counter-narrative of multiple shooters, others believe the mainstream narrative.
    </p>
    
    <p class="indent-1">
        I will probably not take a flat-Earther seriously for his truth, because my truth of a round Earth is so much more popular.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The trick, once you realize that you can create any truth you want for yourself, is to recognize the news for what it is. It's someone else's written version of the truth. And as you consume someone else's truth, parts of it become your own. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        You are a collection of all the experiences you've had - or haven't had, and reading someone else's version of the truth is an experience.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Even right now, because you are reading this, you are developing a new truth from my written version of the truth. You will look at things differently from now on, as you have after countless truth-changing experiences you have already had and will continue to have in your life. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Whenever we experience something that makes us feel something, from an article about how we'll never recover our foreign policy to a family member's death, we create a new truth that stays in place until something else changes it.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        It's always happening. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        So, you want to get into current events, do you?
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Just like anything else in life, you can choose how you want this experience to go. There's no right answer, and there's no optimal way to do it. At the end of your life, you'll die regardless of whether you got into current events at all. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        You have three options, and it's the most clich√© thing ever: 
    </p>
    
    <div class="caption">
        <img width="500px" src="images/news/pills.png">
        Wait, what's the third option?
    </div>
    
    <p>
        If you are wondering what the third option is, let me throw a new truth in your direction, and you can pick it up if you want. The third option is to decline a pill and gather new truths elsewhere. 
    </p>
    
    <h3>What's the difference between the pills?</h3>
    
    <p>
        Same as the difference between republicans and democrats at the end of the day: not much. Some streams will be resonant with your existing truths, and others will be dissonant. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The blue pill is typically associated with streams of consciounsess coming from one of the six largest media companies. They reportedly own something like 90% of the media consumed by Americans, so it's no wonder that their truths are so strong. 
    </p>
    
    <div class="caption">

        21st Century Fox <a target="_blank" href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/136189-Rupert-Murdoch-Tries-to-Buy-Time-Warner-HBO-for-80-Billion-Update">tried</a> to buy TimeWarner, <br>
        but then Disney <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/disney-21st-century-fox-deal-combines-two-of-worlds-biggest-entertainment-giants-live-updates/">went</a> and bought parts of 21st Century Fox!
    </div>
    
    <p>
        The red pill comes from the other 10%, from sites like <a target="_blank" href="http://www.censored.news">this</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p class="indent-1">
        (By the way, if you have now gotten distracted and gone off down an Internet rabbit hole, that's good, because you're more up to date with current events, which is what you wanted. You're welcome. But also not, because reading this isn't exactly helping)
    </p>
    
    <p>
        When one side is flooding the market with their color of pill, it becomes more difficult to find the other color. . It  sucks to be on the less popular side. </p>
