            At work, we have a concept called <em>Core Hours</em>, introduced in a deck called 'Small Enterprise Company Collaboration Policy.'
        </p>

        <p class="quote">
            Core hours are put in place to minimize coordination costs associated with scheduling meetings and other collaboration while still maintaining flexibility for family and things like bing a 'morning' or 'night' person.
        </p>

        <p class="quote">
            Core hours are 10:00 to 16:00. That's when everybody is expected to be in the office so that meetings can be scheduled cheaply. It is also expected that you are in the office for two hours outside of Core Hours. If you're not going to be in the office during Core Hours, you are to get permission from your supervisor and inform your team.
        </p>

        <p>
            So far, so good. The Core Hours policy is quite nice and allows you to be very flexible with when you work. 
        </p>

        <p>
            But you know how sometimes someone makes a really good point, then keeps talking and completely screws everything up? 
        </p>

    <!--
        <p class="indent-1">
            That's this deck. Yep, it goes on to discuss other comments on Core Hours.
        </p>

        <p class="quote">
            The vast majority of life happens outside of those six hours per day
        </p>

        <p>
            Hmmm? Interesting statement.
        </p>

        <p class="quote" >
            It would be nice for everybody else if you could try to get life taken care of before/after Core Hours and on the weeekends
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Get life taken care of? What's that supposed to mean? Is life some annoyance that just gets in the way of work?
        </p>
        
        <p  class="quote">
            Most dentists schedule starting at 8:00 AND until 18:00
        </p>
        
        <p>
            This is a strangely specific thing to include in an announcement on core hours...
        </p>
        
        <h2>A day in the life</h2>
        
        <p>
            Let's go through an average day in the life of an average employee of a small enterprise software company to see if we can figure out what 'the vast majority of life' is supposed to be. I'll use myself as a reference, because if you were to see me walking down the street with my clothes and modern-looking too-small company-branded backpack, you'd think I was an average small enterprise software company employee. 
        </p>

        <p>
            I'll give a description of what I do, followed by a time tracker and whether the time falls into the <strong>work-related</strong> or <strong>life</strong> bucket, as implied by the presentation.
        </p>

        <p class="indent-1">
            Since I don't officially start work until 10:00, I can sleep in until way after the sun has come up. If I have a half-hour commute, if I can get up (actually up - out of bed up) at least 45 minutes before work, I can get in on time. Up until I get out of bed, I'm sleeping.
            <br /> Time tracker: 00:00 - 8:30 - sleep
        </p>

        <p class="indent-1">
            I'll spend the morning getting ready for work. Breakfast, shower, news - all in good time, if available. For the purpose of this exercise, we can assume that I wake up a full one hour before I need to commute.
            <br /> 8:30 - 9:30 - prepare for work
        </p>

        <p class="indent-1">
            I'll walk commute for half an hour. I'll hear music or a podcast. I wouldn't really call it <em>listening</em> because being that I'm on the go, it makes it hard for me to take notes and internalize the concepts. If I take the bus, I can read if I get a good standing position on the crowded bus.
            <br /> 9:30 - 10:00 - commute to work
        </p>

        <p class="indent-1">
            I'll be at work during Core Hours.
            <br /> 10:00 - 16:00 - be at work - Core Hours!
        </p>

        <p class="indent-1">
            Since I got in just before 10:00 and I'm expected to be physically present at work an additional two hours, I'll stay at work for two more hours.
            <br /> 16:00 - 18:00 - be at work
        </p>

        <p class="indent-1">
            Whoo! Off work! Man, am I hungry. Given that it's now 18:00, and a reword for staying late at small enterprise software companies is food for staying late, I'll stay at work for another hour so I can get free food.
            <br /> 18:00 - 19:30 - stay at work longer to unlock free food
        </p>    

        <p class="indent-1">
            When I'm finally finished being at work for the day, I'll commute back home.
            <br /> 19:30 - 20:00 - commute from work        
        </p>

        <p class="indent-1">
            What I do from here gets a little bit less predictive. I can go out with friends, chill at home, play games - it's really up to me what happens now until I should go to bed so I'm not tired for work tomorrow. Assuming that I don't want to be too tired at work the next day, I'll make sure to get into bed by 00:00, falling asleep by latest 01:00 after my eyes go tired from looking at my phone.
            <br /> 20:00 - 23:59 - Free time!
        </p>

        <p>
            So, if we consolidate my workday into the two buckets, we have something that looks like this:
        </p>

            Time                Activity                    Bucket      
            8.5 hours           Sleep                       Life
            1 hour              Get ready                   Work
            1 hour              Commute, total              Work
            9.5 hours           Be at work                  Work
            4 hours             Free time - Anything!       Life

        <p>
            According to the presentation, the 'vast majority of life' happens in the four hours of free time that I have. I'm not counting sleep because it has to happen whether core hours exist as a policy or not. I'm also pretty conservative with how much sleep I get. Several of my coworkers opt to get less sleep during the week, getting their replacement energy and focus from PEDs.
        </p>

        <p>
            Anyway, whose life are we talking about here? If my life is supposed to happen in the four hours of free time I have every day after work, then I'm going to have a pretty shitty life.
        </p>

        <p>
            When you already wish that the presentation would stop, the next bullet reads: 
        </p>

        <p class="quote" >
            it would be nice for everybody else if you could try to get life taken care of before/after Core Hours and on the weeekends
        </p>
