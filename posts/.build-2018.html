    <p>
        Towards the start of last year, I dubbed 2017 to be <em>The Year I Started Thinking</em>, based loosely off of the Laurel and Hardy skit that goes like this:
    </p>
    
    <p class="quote">
        "You know Ollie, I was just thinking." <br /><br />
        "What about?" <br /><br />
        "Nothing, I was just thinking."
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The subtle undertone being that I didn't have to tell anyone exactly what I was thinking about. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Part of it was also getting to a paint where I could focus on the few things that I wanted to focus on, and deleting those that I didn't, so I installed the theme of reduction and goal of simplification.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Now tha the year of thinking has come and gone, I think it's time to move onto something else. Thinking, by itself, does not move any needles. You can think all you want about something - think so hard that you mind nearly explodes - but you will have achieved nothing since before you started thinking.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        As I have already proven to myself, overtly good things happen when you build things that support a specific function. There's a reason it's
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><em>build relationships</em> instead of <em>think relationships</em>,</li>
        <li><em>build rapport</em> instead of <em>imagine rapport</em>, and</li>
        <li><em>build a wall</em> instead of <em>talk about a wall</em>.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
        Thinking is a good first step, but to get anywhere beyond where I currently am, I have to stop thinking so much and start building. So 2018 will be <em>The Year I Started Building</em>.
    </p>
    
    <p class="indent-1">
        How do I make it so?
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Even though I feel as if I haven't thunk as much lately, there are still a bunch of ideas of things I <em>can</em> do in my head, and new ones are generated all the time. I'm not sure which one will be best.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Not being sure about something is the perfect time to sayd, "hmm, guess I have to think about it more," but that is not going to work in the year of building. Thinking about it more is a definite dead-end.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        With that said, I'd like to propose a goal for this year: <strong>Build something worthwhile.</strong>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        To me, something worthwhile is a think that provides benefit to a group of people other than myself. It is something that a group of people would get excited about, recommend to their friends, and would feel comfortable paying for it. But getting people to pay is not the priority. Before I would even feel comfortable asking for payment, I feel like I need to either build something, or understand the benefits that would be produced by the thing that I would build.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The first rule to accompany the goal is: <strong>Do not think more than is required to start building</strong>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Having been in sales, I know how far one can go in trying to figure out what the customer is thinking without actually getting anywhere productive. The entire quarterly business review can be a big circlejerk of assumptions with everybody sharing their anecdotal evidence to back up their conjecture for what the customer actually wants.
    </p>
    
    <p class="indent-1">
        Just ask, why don't you?
    </p>
    
    <p>
        There are a few things in my mind as I write this. One is a dating platform that a friend wants to put together. The second is the Step-To-Freedom guide that you will find a link for at the top of this page. The third is to build a super detailed architecture diagram for my company.
    </p>
    
    <p> 
        There are all things that I have gotten feedback from the outside world to be valuable, so I would consider them worthwhile. They are at various degrees of progress, so I will continue to work on them and solicit feedback from the outside.
