            I'm writing Steps to Freedom, a guide that shows you how to buy back your time so you can fully immerse yourself in what you really want to do, without ever having to dread getting out of bed to go to work.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            To be able to write the guide in a the most effective way possible, I think it's a good idea to try to reset myself back to where I was at the end of 2015, which would have been some combination of:

        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Disoriented</strong>, feeling that my life was all over the place,</li>
            <li><strong>Determined</strong> to change that, but
            <li><strong>Unsure</strong> where to start</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Well, I don't think I can go back to feeling 
            disoriented. 
            Even If I could, I don't think I would want to. The point is not to repeat history, but to learn from it. The system I built is still working, so in order to disorient myself, I would have to undo that system. Or, I suppose I could request a memory wipe.
        </p>

        </div>

        <p>
            I wish I was keeping a journal at that time so I could read back to how I was feeling. I want to write the guide that I wish someone had given me.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Luckily, I had defined what I wanted so clearly, and I wanted it to happen so badly that the next step at any point was clear, and I didn't really have to worry about what happened in the middle. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            But, there were thoughts that kept coming into my head that were existential threats to the outcome.
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">
            What do I think of this? <br /> 
            This is too hard. <br />
            What if I'd be better of <em>not</em> doing it? I can't know, right?<br />
            I have no motivation to do anything now. <br />
            Do I really want this?
            
        </p>

        <p>
            I'm sure that these thoughts will come up again. But now, understanding why they occur, I hope I can manage them better. 
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">
            In the guide, I give you the mental tactics you can use to starve the thoughts that are existential threats to your outcome.
            </p>

            Unexpected things happen when you do things differently. Because I had already made up my mind to leave the large enterprise software company, I didn't properly consider the promotion offer I got. It might have been the best option, but I had already decided emotionally that I wanted out.

            Well, the closest I can get to back where I was at the beginning of round 1 is to reset the numbers.
        </p>

        <p class="indent-1">
            Even if I do though, the beauty of having built a system that just works is that I don't have to do anything. It just keeps working on it's own.

            I could literally not touch it and it'll do its job to completion.
        </p>

        <p>
            Ehh, so maybe resetting the numbers is not enough. I'll rebuild the system. Besides, it'll probably get better if I do.

            I just grabbed a screenshot of the list from the budgeting software that I have been using since end of 2015.
                <sup id="footnote-1-top"><a href="#footnote-1-bottom">1</a></sup>
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Spending account</strong>
            - this is the main account where all the exciting in-and-out action happens. Money comes in every month in the form of salary. Money comes out every month to pay the various credit card accounts accounts you can see below.
        </p>

        <p>
            This account is going to be my main focus: Set the flow to a desired value. We'll figure out what the desired value is after a few budgeting cycles.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>BofA Core Chk</strong>
            - an account that I opened last year to get a $200 or $300 signup bonus. It has a minimum daily account balance of $1500 to avoid fees. I'm keeping it around because I'm using it to generate 15% returns on this amount.
                <sup id="footnote-2-top"><a href="#footnote-2-bottom">2</a></sup>
        </p>

        <p>
            I have considered closing it because even though the percentage gains are high, the actual amount of money is small. But, the amount of time I spend to get said gains is quite small. So for now, that's going to remain as it is. Worst case scenario, I can close it, grab the cash, and add it to the spending account. I won't mind foregoing the small gains or amount of work.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Cash Held</strong>
            - I sold my car at the end of 2016 and the buyer paid in crisp $100 bills. The bills are sitting in my drawer with a binder clip keeping them together. 
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Venmo</strong>    
            - I can subtract a number from my Venmo balance and make it appear in my friend's Venmo balance. Basically cash, but electronic. It's connected to Spending Account. If I send more than what is currently in Venmo, it'll pull from Spending Account.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Credit Cards</strong>
            - I'm not going to go through these. You know what is a credit card. Note that the Barclays card has roughly $100Ï€.
        </p>

        <p>
            So, to reset these all to zero, I'll have to move points out of Spending Account, Cash Held, and Venmo. I'll have to think about what I want to do with BofA Core Chk, because I also use my budget to detect credit card fraud. I could move it out of the YNAB Realm but this makes things more complicated, which, as you might have guessed, I'm not a big fan of.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I might just choose to spend the cash instead of depositing it. I'll treat it as stuff I had lying around that I repurposed to something more useful. Won't really be <em>quite</em> zero, but what do I look like, <a href="images/guy-not-lazy.jpg" target="_blank">a guy who's not lazy</a>?
        </p>

        <p>
            I'll also have to leave just enough in the accounts to be able to cover existing credit card balances.
        </p>

        <p>
            An update on this will be coming in a few posts.

            The <em>real</em> first step is figuring out what you want to do and why.
        </p>
        
        <p class="indent-1">
            Skipping that step is setting yourself up for a really hard time, and likely failure.
