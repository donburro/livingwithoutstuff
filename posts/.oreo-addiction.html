        I just got an increbibly storng craving for an Oreo.
    </p>

    <p>
        I used to eat Oreos like anything when I was a kid. You know those plastic cylinder containers that are filled with like 17 oreos and twelve of them came in a bix blue box?
    </p>
    
    <p>
        That box would last me about two weeks. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Eat oreos and play video games! That's what I did in elementary, middle, and highschool. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The other thing I was really into was the <em>Juic-ey</em>
    </p>

    The only reason I ever went to Costco. 
    
    <p>
        What went really well with juic-ey was chicken nuggets and ketchup. Twelve minutes at 350F in the toaster oven and lunch/dinner is ready. 
    </p>
    
    <p> 
        Fish sticks were okay. I much prefered chicken nuggets. I would have fish sticks if there were no more chicken nuggets.
    </p>
    
    <p> 
        Yea, I had a pretty poor diet.
