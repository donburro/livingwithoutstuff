        Here's a reason why, when building machinery to do something, you should make it properly and complete:
    </p>

    <p>
        I'm at work right now, in the middle of working on a specific task that brings me zero joy or satisfaction, and as you can read, I've stopped doing it and am now writing this. In a way, I feel like a switchboard operator.
    </p>

    <p class="quote" id="switchboard-quote-source-top">
        Switchboard operators are typically required to have very strong communication skills.

        Hey, as an employee at a quickly-growing small enterprise software company, I am supposed to have strong communication skills to ensure collaborative synergy. 
    </p>

    If it's not already clear, here are five reasons you should think about the long-term when creating a system: 

    <ol class="texty-list">
        <li>
            <p>
                <strong>Humans are the worst at doing mundane things in a repetitive fashion</strong> <br />
                It's not going to be true for everyone, but it sure is true for me. Once I get really, really good at doing something, like the thing I stopped doing to write this list, I start hating it. Even though I'm really good at doing it, having me do it is a very inefficient way of performing the task. Honestly, I feel like a highly paid switchboard operator. If this was the only thing I could do at work, I'd be gone already. 
            </p>

        <li>
            <p>
                <strong>It's much, much more prone to error</strong><br />
                Being that I don't really care to much about the task at hand, I'm likely to let the quality of the output slip. Each time I have to make a decision, I get fatigued and wish the task would go faster so I can be done with it sooner. Not sure what to do about this particular thing? I should research it, click on the links to learn more, maybe do a seach on some of the strings... nah, just ignore it and move on. Nobody will know the difference. 
            </p>

            <p>
                False negatives are not too bad as long as there's no mention of the condition or attribute being present. But, a sloppy job can also result in false positives, which can be much worse. The output of my work would ultimately get put into some sort of report, and it's no good if a report containing false positives goes to the customer. Each time I have to make a conscious decision based on several different input data, the chance for that happening increases. 
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>
                <strong>It's really expensive to not do it right</strong><br />
                The small enterprise software company that employs my services, powered by investor dollars, has a limited amount of time to get to self-sufficiency. If the company can't get to that point, leadership will have to look for exits before the valuation drops too low and money runs out. I'm expensive. There are several others on my direct team that do similar work - they are all expensive. If we are doing work that could be automatically done by a machine, then we are being drastically overpaid for what we're doing, and the company is losing more money than it needs to.
            </p>

            <p>
                The amount of upfront work needed to build a system properly pales in comparison to what'll spend on maintaining it later on. The opportunity cost of paying several people to do a bunch of pixel-moving tasks instead of working on growing the business is tremendous.
            </p>

        </li>

        <li>
            <p>
                <strong>Nobody wants to fix old problems</strong> <br />
                These tools are the result of engineering projects. When a peice of machinery needs to get built, a team is allocated to the task to see it through to completion. When the project is done and the result delivered, that's it - it's now time to move on to other projects. Sure, bugs will be fixed, but core functionality? If part of the core functionality is to have a human do exception handling, it's going to be that way until the core functionality changes. Change the core functionality? No, we can't do that now, there are more important things to work on today. Besides, the task can still get done, even if it takes a bit longer and it's more expensive.
            </p>

    </ol>
