            I feel like there is too much going on. Like I don't have any time to myself.
        </p>

        <p class="i-1">
            No time to breathe.
        </p>

        <p>
            At the same time, I feel like if I'm not doing SOMETHING, I'm wasting my time away and being unproductive.
        </p>

        <p>
            I'm already four years out of college and I don't have that much to say about what I've done in my life since then other than sit at a job entering things into the computer... like what I'm doing here, except for some other reason than talking about my life. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Isn't that some shit?
        </p>

        <p>
            My friend once told me, 
        </p>

        <p class="quote">
            "I don't want to wake up when I'm 30 and think, 'huh, this is it? This is my life? I'm working at a job that I don't love - don't hate it either, and have free time to do some of the things I like on the side. I'm not <strong>super</strong> happy. Life's just <em>okay</em>."
        </p>
        
        <p> 
            That hit hard.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            My manager told me the funniest story during our first 1-1 meeting.
        </p>
        
        <div class="quote">
            
            <p>
                You know, the funniest thing happened to me this morning.
            </p>

            <p>
                I had just gotten back from my trip last night, around 11. I got back, just relaxed, and went to bed.
            </p>

            <p>
                Shot off a few emails in bed before going to sleep.
            </p>

            <p>
                But I couldn't sleep very well. 
            </p>

            <p>
                My wife usually drops me off at the train on her way to school in the morning, but today she left early, so I called a Lyft.
            </p>

            <p>
                So I go out, the guy shows up, and offers to help me put my suitcase in the trunk.
            </p>

            <p>
                And as he's doing that, I'm observing the situation and thinking, "Man, there is something off here"
            </p>

            <p>
                Then it hit me... 
            </p>

            <p>
                So I tell him as he's putting my suitcase in the trunk, "Sorry, I need to get my suitcase."
            </p>

            <p>
                And he says, "oh, no problem it can be in the trunk."
            </p>

            <p>
                So I say, "No, you don't understand. I made a mistake. I actually don't need to bring my suitcase with me. I'm just going to work today, I'll be back later. I need to get it and put it inside my house. I'm really sorry. Be right back."
            </p>
            
        </div>
        
        <p>
            When I reminded him of the story a couple months later, he said that it was a low point for him. He pours a lot of himself into his work and I wouldn't be surprised if he was just so stressed that he couldn't think straight that morning.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Do you ever get the feeling that someone is sending you little messages here and there about what to do, what not to do, and ultimately how to live your life?
        </p>
        
        <h2>The highest option</h2>
        
        <p>
            In any scenario, the best thing you can do is tell the truth. Even if it does not seem like the best option, it is. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            If you do not tell the truth, you do not respect the person you're talking to because you not being honest. 
        </p>
        
        <p class="i-1">
            If that person is you, you're not respecting yourself. Isn't it crazy that we would even lie to ourselves?
        </p>
        
        <p> 
            If my boss asks me whether I enjoy my job, I would instantly be inclined to blurt out, <em>"yes, of course!"</em>
        </p>
        
        <p class="i-1">
            That's what I'm supposed to say. If I didn't tell my manager that I didn't enjoy my job, why am I working there? If I'm doing the job without my heart in it, I'm not doing my best work. He may start talking to the HR person about how to lay me off. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I like my job the way I like doing dishes after cooking. Sure, there are parts that are not ideal, but <em>that's just the way it is.</em> I can't ask for every part of my job to be perfectly fulfilling, especially in a role that was being created as I was interviewing for it. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <strong>But it's not the truth.</strong>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The truth would be to tell him that I don't, and I feel the need to stop putting it first and be more self-centered, because I might show up to work with my suitcase one day going nowhere.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The message from my boss's story is very clear to me: listen to what comes through the speakers of the universe or <a href="older-posts.html#the-second-coming-to">learn the lesson the hard way</a>.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I hope he's getting paid really well.
        </p>
    
        <p class="i-1"> 
            But what good is money if you aren't mentally around to enjoy it?
        </p>
        
        <h2>Coming to terms with myself</h2>
        
        <p>
            What did you want to be when you grew up? Is that you now? Does it feel like that is ever going to happen?
        </p>
        
        <p class="i-1">
            Does that even matter?
        </p>
        
        <p>
            What about now? What do you want to be today? Are you that? Does it feel like that is ever going to happen?
        </p>
        
        <p class="i-1">
            Why the doubt?
        </p>
        
        <p>
            What's absolutely CRAZY to me is that we have the gift of free will, which comes with the opportunity, no, the <em>ability</em> to do whatever we want to do, to be whoever we want to be. Yet most people never take that opportunity.
        </p>

        <p>
            Most people DO wake up when they're 30, 40, even 60, and think, <em>"Huh, this is my life? That's it? I wish I had lived more..."</em> We hear this <strong>all the time</strong> from people in old age reflecting on their life.
        </p>

        <p class="i-1">
            They wish they had <strong>lived</strong> more in their <strong>life</strong>. Isn't that crazy?
        </p>
        
        <p> 
            I don't think it's ever too late to start doing something, though I do think it can <em>feel</em> too late. I guess that's the feeling that leads you to wish you had lived more. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I've had this feeling about my grade school and college years. Looking back, there are things I wish I had done, risks I wish I had taken. In those years, I never thought I would look back and think those things because I always thought that life would become much better, more interesting, and whatever eles, that I didn't think I would even have time to look back, wishing I had lived more.
        </p>
        
        <p class="i-1">
            If I keep the same mentality, I'm going to be writing this exact same thing ten, twenty, and fifty years from now. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Other than the feeling of it being too late for us to do something we want to do, there's another that I've noticed is very pervasive in society today.
        </p>
        
        <p> 
            That feeling is this: 
        </p>
        
        <p class="quote">
            There are so many people in this world that don't have a tenth of what you have. You're so lucky to have a job, a roof over your head, and not have to worry about where your next meal is coming from. You should feel <strong>greatful</strong> that you have it so good already.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            It hits hard because you know it's true.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            You have a roof over your head, you have a job, you don't have to worry about where you're getting your next meal, you have a computer with access to a worldwide web of information that can teach you anything, and enough free time to read the shit I'm writing. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            And there are a lot of people in this world that have none of those things. Mostly, because of the situation they were born into.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            You are very lucky to have been born into a situation where you have the opportunity to be who you want to be.
        </p>
        
        - What is in your control?
        - Life is not fair. 
        - Don't beat yourself up over it.
        - The people that are telling you that want you to have a victim complex. 
        - Think about what it is they are telling you: You shouldn't be who you want to be because your life is good enough already. Do you agree with that? Is that a good mindset to have? 
        
        <p>
            But if you're comparing yourself to the billions that are less "fortunate" than you, and decide that what you are right now is good enough - even if it is not what you desire to be - you don't have to take the opportunity.
        </p>
        
        <p class="i-1">
            You just might regret it later.
        </p>
        
        <p class="i-2">
            There are guarantees for a good life. But they do not come automatically.
        </p>

        <p>
            What can you guarantee yourself if you do nothing but keep waiting for the next raise? Promotion? Keep waiting for the million-dollar idea to come to you? Keep waiting for things to get better? Where will you be six months from now? A year? Ten years?
        </p>

        <p>
            I can guarantee you that the answer to those questions sound better today than they will in ten years.
        </p>

        <p>
            Don't live on someone else's time. It's 7:43 here for me and I have to stop to leave for work to make it in for a meeting, even though I wish I could keep writing because I'm really in the mood to do that right now.
        </p>

        <p>
            I'm just going to grab my suitcase and head out for the day.    
        </p>
