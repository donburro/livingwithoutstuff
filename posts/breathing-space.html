            I feel like there is too much going on. Like I don't have any time to myself.
        </p>

        <p class="i-1">
            No time to breathe.
        </p>

        <p>
            At the same time, I feel like if I'm not doing SOMETHING, I'm wasting my time away and being unproductive.
        </p>

        <p>
            Yet, I'm four years out of college and I don't have that much to say about what I've done in my life since then. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Isn't that some shit?
        </p>

        <p>
            My friend once told me, 
        </p>

        <p class="quote">
            "I don't want to wake up when I'm 30 and think, 'huh, this is it? This is my life? I'm working at a job that I don't love - don't hate it either, and have free time to do some of the things I like on the side. I'm not <strong>super</strong> happy. Life's just <em>okay</em>."
        </p>
        
        <p> 
            That hit hard.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I got a new boss at work due to a compary re-org. During our first 1-1, he told me a story.
        </p>
        
        <p class="quote">
            You know, the funniest thing happened to me this morning.
        </p>
        
        <p class="quote">
            So I had just gotten back from my trip last night, around 11. I got back, just relaxed, and went to bed.
        </p>
        
        <p class="quote">
            Shot off a few emails in bed before going to sleep.
        </p>
        
        <p class="quote">
            But I couldn't sleep very well. 
        </p>
        
        <p class="quote">
            My wife usually drops me off at the train on her way to school in the morning, but today she left early, so I called a Lyft.
        </p>
        
        <p class="quote">
            So I go out, the guy shows up, and offers to help me put my suitcase in the trunk.
        </p>
        
        <p class="quote">
            And as he's doing that, I'm observing the situation and thinking, "Man, there is something off here"
        </p>
        
        <p class="quote">
            Then it hit me... 
        </p>
        
        <p class="quote">
            So I tell him as he's putting my suitcase in the trunk, "Sorry, I need to get my suitcase."
        </p>
        
        <p class="quote">
            And he says, "oh, no problem it can be in the trunk."
        </p>
        
        <p>
            So I say, "No, you don't understand. I made a mistake. I actually don't need to bring my suitcase with me. I'm just going to work today, I'll be back later. I need to get it and put it inside my house. I'm really sorry. Be right back."
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I didn't know whether to feel sorry for the guy or whether it was just a normal slip of the mind. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            But I know that he pours a lot of himself into his work that I wouldn't be surprised if he was so stressed that he couldn't think straight that morning.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            At the risk of sounding strangely spiritual, I think it was a message from God.
        </p>
        
        <h2>The highest option</h2>
        
        <p>
            In any scenario, the best thing you can do is tell the truth.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Even if it does not seem like the best option.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            But it is the highest option. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            If you do not tell the truth, you do not love because you are being less than honest.
        </p>
        
        <p> 
            If my boss asks me whether I enjoy my job, I would instantly be inclined to tell him that I do.
        </p>
        
        <p class="i-1">
            That's what everybody says. Sure, there are parts that are not ideal, but <em>that's just the way it is.</em> I can't ask for every part of my life to be perfect, especially in a role that was being created as I was interviewing for it. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            But it's not the truth.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The truth would be to tell him that I don't, and I feel that I need to stop putting it first, because otherwise I might accidentally bring my suitcase to work with me one day.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The message is very clear to me: listen to what my boss is telling me or learn the lesson the hard way.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I hope he's getting paid really well.
        </p>
    
        <p class="i-1"> 
            But what good is money if you aren't mentally around to enjoy it?
        </p>
        
        <h2>Coming to terms with myself</h2>
        
        <p>
            What did you want to be when you grew up? Is that you now? Does it feel like that is ever going to happen?
        </p>
        
        <p class="i-1">
            Does that even matter?
        </p>
        
        <p>
            What about now? What do you want to be today? Are you that? Does it feel like that is ever going to happen?
        </p>
        
        <p class="i-1">
            Why the doubt?
        </p>
        
        <p>
            What's absolutely CRAZY to me is that we have the gift of free will, which comes with the opportunity, no, the <em>ability</em> to do whatever we want to do, and to be whoever we desire to be. Yet most people never take that opportunity.
        </p>

        <p>
            Most people DO wake up when they're 30, 40, even 60, and think, "Huh, this is my life? That's it?" and wish they would have lived more. We hear this <em>all the time</em> from people reflecting on their youth. 
        </p>

        <p class="i-1">
            Isn't that crazy? They wish they had <em>lived</em> more in life.
        </p>
        
        <p> 
            I don't think it's even too late to start doing something, but I do think it can <em>feel</em> too late. But I guess that's the feeling that leads you to wish you had lived more.
        </p>
        
        <p> 
            The other feeling that leads you there is the one where you think of all the people that are worse off than you are, and that you should feel greatful for having it so good already.
        </p>
        
        <p class="i-1">
            You have a roof over your head, you don't have to worry about where you're getting your next meal, and you have enough free time to read the shit I'm writing. 
        </p>
        
        <p class="i-1">
            You're already very lucky to have the opportunity to be who you want to be so readily available to you. A lot of people don't even have access to the opportunity because of where they were born, what group of people are in power where they are - and these are things that are totally out of their control. Just HAVING the opportunity means that you already live a pretty good life. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            But if you're comparing yourself to the billions that are less "fortunate" than you, and decide that what you are right now is good enough - even if it is not what you desire to be - you don't have to take the opportunity.
        </p>
        
        <p class="i-1">
            You just might regret it later.
        </p>
        
        <p class="i-2">
            There are guarantees for a good life. But they do not come automatically.
        </p>

        <p>
            What can you guarantee yourself if you do nothing but keep waiting for the next raise? Promotion? Keep waiting for the million-dollar idea to come to you? Keep waiting for things to get better? Where will you be six months from now? A year? Ten years?
        </p>

        <p>
            I can guarantee you that the answer to those questions sound better today than they will in ten years.
        </p>

        <p>
            Don't live on someone else's time. It's 7:43 here for me and I have to stop to leave for work to make it in for a meeting, even though I wish I could keep writing because I'm really in the mood to do that right now.
        </p>

        <p>
            I'm just going to grab my suitcase and head out for the day.    
        </p>
