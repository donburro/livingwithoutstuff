            Four months ago, I wrote about <a href="shitty-morning.html">a strategy you can use</a> to not have a shitty morning.
        </p>

        <p>
            The strategy still applies, but there's an even better thing that you can do in the morning than get the shit out of your system: whatever you want.
        </p>

        <p class="i-1">
            Work on your business. Go for a walk. Write some blog posts. Workout. Learn something new. Make yourself a fantastic breakfast.
        </p>

        <p>
            It may sound so cliche, but it's true. When I rise before I have to make my way way to my job, it feels like the world is mine. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            There are several benefits:

        <div class="texty-list">
            <p>
                <strong>I can do whatever I choose.</strong> I was struggling with deciding what to do this morning when I got out of bed at 3:30 because there are so many things I want to work on. For an hour, I sat, paralyzed, just thinking: out of all the things I <em>could</em> do, what would be the <em>most impactful</em> thing for me to do? I realized that whatever I did would be more impactful than thinking about it.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>I'm not tired</strong> in the way I am after coming home from work. When I get home, I'm most inclined to <a href="../distraction-portal/">veg out and watch stupid videos on YouTube</a> simply because my mind and body are tired. Because I just woke up, I don't have that problem.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>I don't feel like I'm wasting my life.</strong> I don't feel guilty for being tired, or for <a href="../distraction-portal/">getting distracted</a> when I come home from work. I can indulge in however I'm feeling later in the day. Feel like writing a post? Great. Feel like doing nothing, watching a show, or playing games? Also great.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>I can take things slow.</strong> If I stay in bed until the last possible minute, I'll be in a rush to get out the door. As a result, I'll be in a rush all day. I don't understand why, but it does seem to work that way. Getting up early means that I can spend a good amount of time on whatever I'm working on. If I wanted to spend an hour making breakfast, I can do that AND enjoy eating it.

           You know, I think I understand the <a href="core-hours-life.html">collaboration policy</a> a bit better now. Most of life <em>does</em> happen outside of core hours.

            I just can't. It's too hard. I keep falling back asleep after hitting snooze. I like my bed so much. This mattress is too comfortable.

            That's cute.
