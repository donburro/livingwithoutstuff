        <p> 
            Earlier this year, I had the unique opportunity to attend a talk lead by Harry Markowitz at the USF School of Management. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Harry Markowitz is a legend in the personal finance space, often known as the father of modern portfolio theory. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            His work is the reason that low-cost index funds are all the rave today. Before he published his work, most investors and fund managers convinced people with money to invest (you and me) to pay them a lot of money because they were finance experts with intellect and superior stock-picking techniques that could beat the market. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            In 1950, he showed us how wrong we were. Since then, people have been diversifying their portfolios by buying multiple securities to achieve <em>optimal asset allocation</em>. Of course, people still pay hefty fees to have their money managed by finance experts with intellect and superior stock-picking techniques, but they typically end up with a portfolio that will track the market anyway. The finance expert wants to keep his job, after all.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Harry Markowitz's work changed the world of investing, and for it, he won the John von Neumann Award in 1989, and the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1990.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            His work enables me to know how I should adjust my portfolio so that I may acheive the best return without taking on additional risk.

            Whoops, I'm taking on additional risk for not much more reward. <br>
            Thanks Harry!

        <p>
            Without further ado, here are the notes that I took from his talk, copied verbatim from my journal.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Enjoy!
