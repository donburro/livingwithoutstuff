    <p> 
        I feel like theure is too much going on. I don't have any time to myself - no time to breathe.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        But, I feel like if I'm not doing SOMETHING, I'm wasting my time away and being unproductive.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Yet, I'm four years out of college and I'm not sure I have that much to say about what I've done in my life in that time. Time goes fast! Where does it all go?
    </p>
    
    <p>
        My friend once told me, "I don't want to wake up when I'm 30 and think, 'huh, this is it? This is my life? I'm working at a job that I don't hate - don't love it either, and have free time to do some of the things I like on the side. I'm not <strong>super</strong> happy. Life's just <em>okay</em>."
    </p>

    <p> 
        So this is what the program is all about. It's the first step in a lifelong journey towards freedom. If you know you're headed somewhere you're not incredibly excited about, it's time to rethink. You have the freedom and ability to do so, so why not?
    </p>
    
    <p class="indent-1">
        What did you want to be when you grew up? Is that you now? Does it feel like that is ever going to happen?
    </p>
    
    <p class="indent-1">
        Do you feel like you don't have enough time to do the things that you want? If you're like me and most others, your work takes up most of your time. Unless you're working on something you really want to be working on, it will feel like work is the biggest sink on your time. Well, can you just leave work and live your ideal days for a month or two? Why not?
    </p>
    
    <p>
        You have the OPPORTUNITY to be free to do whatever you want to do. But most people never take that opportunity.
    </p>
    
    <p class="indent-1">
        Most people DO wake up when they're 30, 40, even 60, and think, "Huh, this is my life? That's it?" and wish they would have done more and taken more chances earlier in life. It's something I hear <em>all the time</em> from people when they are talking about their youth. I don't think it's even too late to start doing something, but I do think it can <em>feel</em> too late.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        But you don't have to take the opportunity, of course. You're already very lucky to be the part of the world's population to have the opportunity. A lot of people don't even have access to the opportunity because of where they were born, what group of people are in power where they are - things that are totally out of their control. Just HAVING the opportunity means that you already live a pretty good life. 
    </p>

    <p> 
        The only thing that you'd be doing is making it better. And if you make your life better, you're more likely to be able to make other people's lives better as well. Because of this, I think it's foolish to not take the opportunity. I believe we all have an innate obligation to make as many people's lives as good as possible. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Of course - you can continue going as you are. Do nothing. Keep waiting for the the raise. Keep waiting for the million-dollar idea to come to you. Keep waiting for things to get better. But where will you be six months from now? A year?
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Probably in the same place. Maybe not physically, but in the same state of mind, with the same troubles and the same desires - and all of them feel just as out of reach as they have ever felt. Unless you do something about it. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Take action. It doesn't even have to be going through the steps I've laid out. It can be anything that gets you somewhere. Just do something. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Don't live on someone else's time. It's 7:43 here for me and I have to stop to leave for work to make it in for a meeting, even though I <em>wish I could keep writing</em> because I'm really in the mood to do that right now.
