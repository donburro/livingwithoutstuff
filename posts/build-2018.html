        <p>
            Towards the start of last year, I dubbed 2017 to be <em>The Year I Started Thinking</em>, based loosely off of the Laurel and Hardy skit that goes like this:
        </p>

        <p class="quote">
            "You know Ollie, I was just thinking." <br /><br />
            "What about?" <br /><br />
            "Nothing, I was just thinking."
        </p>

        <p>
            The subtle undertone being that I didn't have to tell anyone exactly what I was thinking about because it's really not that important unless the thought is one that I want to bring to life in the world. Not all, but most, thoughts are dumb, lame, and dangerous, but it can be hard to know that when the thought occurs.
        </p>

        <p>
            Part of it was also getting to a point where I could focus on the few things that I wanted to focus on, and deleting the rest, so I installed the theme of reduction and goal of simplification.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now tha the year of thinking has come and gone, I think it's time to move onto something else. Thinking, by itself, does not move any needles. You can think all you want about something - think so hard that you mind feels like it's going to explode - but you will have achieved nothing since before you started thinking.
        </p>

        <p>
            As I have already proven to myself, overtly good things happen when you build things that support a specific function. There's a reason it's
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><em>build relationships</em> instead of <em>think relationships</em>,</li>
            <li><em>build rapport</em> instead of <em>think rapport</em>, and</li>
            <li><em>build a wall</em> instead of <em>think about a wall</em>.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Of course, you have to think about the thing before you can make it happen. That is obvious. But for me, I have spent too much of my life thinking about all sorts of grand ideas that are still just that: thoughts. It's time to stop thinking so much and start building. So 2018 will be <em>The Year I Started Building</em>.
        </p>

        <p class="indent-1">
            How do I make it so?
        </p>

        <p>
            Even though I feel as if I haven't thunk as much lately, there are still a bunch of ideas of things I <em>can</em> do in my head, and new ones are generated all the time. I'm not sure which one will be best.
        </p>
        
        <p class="i-1"> 
            (Does it even matter?)
        </p>
        
    
        <p>
            Not being sure about something is the perfect time to say, <em>"hmm, guess I have to think about it more,"</em> but that is not going to work in the year of building. Thinking about it more is a definite dead-end.
        </p>

        <p>
            With that said, my goal for this year: <strong>Build something worthwhile.</strong>
        </p>
        
        <p class="i-1">
            This goes on top of the past two year's goals of the annual spending forecast and simplification.
        </p>

        <p>
            Hm, I think it would be a good idea to define what something worthwhile is. (Oh boy, here I go <em>thinking</em> again...)
        </p>
        
        <p>
            To me, something worthwhile is a thing that provides benefit to a person not myself. It is something that a group of people would get excited about, recommend to their friends, and would feel comfortable paying for it. It is <em>worth</em> their <em>while</em>. While getting people to pay is not the priority, if people are willing to pay for it, it is worth something. That is a the measure I will be using to determine whether I have succeeded in this goal.
        </p>

        <p>
            The first rule to accompany the goal is: <strong>Do not think more than is required to start building</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Having been in sales, I know how far one can go in trying to figure out what the customer is thinking without actually getting anywhere productive. The entire quarterly business review can be a big circlejerk of assumptions with everybody sharing their anecdotal evidence to back up their conjecture for what the customer actually wants.
        </p>

        <p class="indent-1">
            Just ask, why don't you?
        </p>

        <p>
            There are a few things in my mind as I write this. One is a dating platform that a friend wants to put together. The second is the <a href="http://livingwithoutstuff.com/step-to-freedom/index.html">Step-To-Freedom guide</a>. The third is to build a feedback system for my employer.
        </p>

        <p> 
            These are all things that I have gotten some feedback from the outside world to be valuable, so I would consider them worthwhile. They are at various degrees of progress, so I will continue to work on them and see what happens.
