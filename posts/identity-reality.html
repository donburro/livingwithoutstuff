            I overheard a group of friends talking about someone on the bus ride home today.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Her name was Julie.
        </p>
        
        <p class="convo convo-1">
            Hmm, don't remember Julie.
        </p>
        
        <p class="convo convo-2">
            You know, Julie. Smokes a lot. Wears those cool sunglasses. 
        </p>
        
        <p class="convo convo-1">
            Oh, that Julie.
        </p>
        
        <p class="convo convo-2">
            Yea, she's really cool.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I wonder if Julie knows that her friends<sup>1</sup> identify her that way. I wonder if she cares.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            If Julie had access to the filesystem where Facebook captured what you say, I wonder if she would listen to the records under her friend's profile.
        </p>
        
        <p class="i-1">
            I'm sure she would. I mean, if given the opportunity, I would too. Just for fun. 
        </p>
        
        <p class="i-2">
            The litigation comes when you use those files for blackmail. If you do get the chance, don't use them against anyone, unless it's for a good cause.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The occurence on the bus reminded me that I do often wonder what others think of me. Sometimes I worry about what others think of me, from a guy whose way I got in on the street to my boss. I want people to have good things to say about me. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I want people to view me as a good person. Doesn't everybody?
        </p>
        
        <p>
            But this is an impossible task.
        </p>

            The same as finishing this post right now.
