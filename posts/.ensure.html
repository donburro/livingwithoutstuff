        One of my recently friends just posted an Instagram story:

        Using them as supplements
    </div>

    <p> 
        As you know from my earlier post on toothpaste, I like to keep track on what people are doing and how they are thinking about various products on the market because it helps me to inform my portfolio decisions. Obviously, I can't base most of my decisions based on what I think of most things, because after doing a little bit of research, I find out that you don't need them, they don't provide the benefits they claim, or they are bad for your health. 
    </p>

    <p>
        In the case of Ensure, its the latter two items.
    </p>
    
    <p class="indent-1">
        Hey, the name of his blog is <em>Living Without Stuff</em>, not <em>Living With Stuff That Will Kill You Faster</em>.
    </p>

    <p id="source-1-top">
        If you aren't familiar with Ensure, it's a #1 doctor recommended source of complete, balanced nutrition in a bottle manufactured by Abbot Laboratories. Each shake is packed with 24 essential vitamins and minerals.
        <sup><a href="#source-1">1</a></sup>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Ensure comes in a variety of different forms that you can pick from depending on what you want to acheive.
    </p>
    
    <p class="indent-1">   
        If you want to lose weight, there's one for you. If you want to gain or maintain weight, there's one for you. If you just had surgery and need to reduce insulin resistance, gee golly, there's one for you too.
    </p>
    
    <div class="caption">
        <img src="images/ensure/ensure-options.png">
        Many different options to choose from based on where you are in life.
    </div>
    
    <p>
        If you go to the Ensure website, you can take a <a href="https://ensure.com/nutrition-products/protein-shakes-healthy-drinks" target="_blank">survey</a>
        that will ensure that you find the right Ensure for your needs.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        I first learned about Ensure a few years ago when my grandma came back from the hospital after having water buildup in her lungs. 
    </p>
    
    <p class="indent-1">
        I remember the events around the incident quite well. I had made a weekend trip home from college to celebrate her birthday. We all went out to a fancy-type low-lighting restaurant where the dinner menu was set and you mainly chose your drinks. The lobster tasted like nothing, so my dad and I kept asking for more lime and salt to put on the thing. I wonder if that upset the chef.
    </p>
    
    <p class="indent-1">
        The next morning, she was throwing up, having a really hard time breathing - we all thought it might be the beginning of her end, including her. We rushed her to the hospital and they started running tests immediately.
    </p>
    
    <p class="indent-1">
        They were close to having to perform surgery to have stents put in her, but she fought hard and recovered to the point where the doctors deemed it unnecessary.
    </p>
    
    <p class="indent-1">
        The next time I came up to visit, I came through the garage and saw several boxes of a thing called <em>Ensure</em>. I picked one up and looked at the ingredients.
    </p>
    
    <div class="inline-image">
        <img width="300px" align="right" src="images/ensure/ensure-ingredients.jpeg">
    </div>
    
    <p>
        From my prior research on nutrition, I immediately recognized several ingredients that are not part of a healthy diet because they promote inflammation, cancer, diabetes, and a bunch of other bad things.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        There were also some I had not heard of before. It might be surprising to know, but with the Internet, you can find a lot of information on a thing just by entering the name of the thing into a search bar. Google works particularly well for this.
    </p>
    
    <p class="indent-1">
        The steps to do research on a thing are: <br />
        1. Enter name of thing you want to learn about. <br />
        2. Click on the links and start reading. <br />
        3. If you have another thing you want to learn about, go back to step 1.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        One of the ingredients that I learned about at this time was Carrageenan. If I search now for 'Carrageenan' this is what I get:
    </p>
    
    <div class="caption">
        <img src="images/ensure/ensure-carrageenan-search.png">
    </div>
    
    <p>
        Let's go on a bit of a detour from the main point of the post and go through each of these links, starting with the sponsored result.
    </p>
    
    <p id="source-2-top">
        The first result comes from FMC Corporation on their website foodsciencematters.com. The domain is owned by Du Pont. Du Pont and FMC's businesses seem to mutually benefit each other.
        <sup><a href="#source-2">2</a></sup>
        Google displays this result as being an ad.
    </p>
    
    <div class="indent-1">
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.whois.com/whois/foodsciencematters.com">
            <img src="images/ensure/ensure-domainwhois-fmc.png">
        </a>
    </div>
    
    <p>
        The page on Du Pont's website starts with an overview of what is Carrageenan, discusses its social and environmental benefits, provides a list of foods that contain it and why, then explains in great detail why Carrageenan is not bad for you, noting that 'you may have heard some rumors of health concerns surrounding carrageenan safety' and that there is a lot of misinformation and misguided science out there, and it can be difficult to know what is true and what is not.' 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The page wraps up the discussion with making sure that you understand that it's safe once more, then gives a very nicely illustrated history of Carrageenan.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The second result comes from Wellness Mama on her website wellnessmama.com.
        The domain is registered to a private registrant through Tucows. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The page opens in a similar fashion to FMC Corp's page, giving a short overview of what is Carrageenan, straight from 'the Google,' then dives into all of the problems associated with it, using quotes from doctors and researchers in the field to support the claims. The site does get you to try to sign up for a mailiing list in many different ways, which I found slightly annoying.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The conclusion is that Carrageenan 'may not be as bad as some sources portray, but there is evidence that it can be harmful, especially if consumed regularly.' So her family avoids it because there is an unknown risk that is not worth taking, and it's main purpose is thickening and does not serve a nutritional purpose.
    </p>
    
    <p id="source-3-top">
        The final result we'll look at on this detour is Dr. Weil's page drweil.com. The domain is registered to Larry Tree of Weil Lifestyle, LLC, 'an organization founded by Andrew Weil, M.D., is the leading resource for education, information, products, services and philanthropic contributions based on the principles of integrative medicine'
        <sup><a href="#source-3">3</a></sup>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The page is found in the Q&A section, the question being 'Is Carrageenan safe?' The answer starts with an explanation of what is Carrageene and where it's found, just like the other pages. Dr. Weil references studies done by Joanne K. Tobacman, MD in 2012 which found that 'exposure to carrageenan causes inflammation and that when we consume processed foods containing it, we ingest enough to cause inflammation in our bodies' which is the root cause of new diseases like heart disease, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and cancer.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The article ends with telling us that the European Union has banned it for use in infant formula, while the FDA and WHO say it not of concern in concentrations up to 1000 mg/L. His official recommendation is to avoid consuming Carrageenan.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <strong>Horaay! Detour complete!</strong>
    </p>
    
    <p> 
        So, after doing iterative research on Carageenan and several of the other ingredienst listed on the bottle, I went to my grandma and told her to not drink it unless she wanted to risk dying more quickly. 
    </p>
    
    <p class="indent-1">
        Imagine that, being told by your grandson that drinking this thing that you were told was good for you would kill you faster. I wonder what people thought of that...
    </p>
    
    <p>
        It turns out that my cousin's wife, a registered dietician, had recommended Ensure to my grandma to make sure that she was getting all the nutrients she needs because she typically eats very little.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        As always, I got a lot of pushback on my advice because I was up against a registered dietician, wife of the golden child of the family, who can literally do noting wrong. But, a while later, my grandma said Ensure made her feel strange and she stopped drinking it. 
    </p>
    
    <p class="indent-1">
        I'm glad that she did. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        But that's not really what I'm here to tell you! I'm here to tell you to buy ABT, remember, because of this:
    </p>
    
    <div class="caption">
        <img src="images/ensure/ensure-story.png">
        ABT currently has a dividend yield of 1.97%
    </div>
    
    <p>
        Almost everyone American today has access to the Internet, and many carry supercomputers in their pockets all day. Information like that we reviewed today is literally at everyone's fingertips. 
    </p>
    
    <p id="source-4-top">
        Despite that, the increase in 2016 U.S. Adult Nutritional revenues was driven by the growth of Ensure sales, which account for about 35% of Abbott's revenues.
        <sup><a href="#source-4">4</a></sup>
    </p>
    
    <p>
       My point is this: ABT looks like a pretty good investment, but I would not have considered investing in it because I would <em>never</em> purchase Ensure, or most other products - until I saw my friend's post.
    </p>
    
    <p class="indent-1">
        The 'purchase the stock of the companies that you believe in' concept doesn't apply here. You should instead follow the concept of 'purchase the stock of the companies that <em>others</em> believe in.'
    </p>
    
    <p>
        It doesn't matter what <em>I</em> believe. It doesn't matter what you believe. It only matters what <em>most people</em> believe, because they are the market. I am not Abbott's target audience, and they know that. Their target audience is the mass of people who will take the advice of 'experts' like the FDA, WHO, and their registered dieticians - like my cousin's wife - without spending time to figure out what it is they are putting into their bodies.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Abbott's target audience are those who fall for this:
    </p>
    
    <div class="caption">
        <img src="images/ensure/ensure-is-no-1.png">
        Ensure came out #1 out of 1 product(s) reviewed
    </div>
    
    <p>
        Because Ensure contains ingredients that may potentailly have negative effects on ones health, there are other related investments that we can discuss at a later time. For example, if regular consumption of Ensure is linked to increased chances of diabetes, there are several companies pumping out products to solve that problem whose profits should increase as a result.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Investment risks</h3>
    
    <p>
        There are risks associated with any investment, so let's review some of them.
    </p>
    
    <ol class="texty-list">
        <li>
            <p>
                <strong>Consumers start doing research</strong> <br />
                The first risk is that consumers will start doing research on Ensure, realize that it's bad for them, and stop purchasing it. This will cause sales to come to a halt as consumers look for alternatives.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I'd say that this is a low risk, because companies in the healthcare space tend to have very good contingency plans for things like this. The introduction of similar, but differently branded, new product, coupled with approval and recommendation from regulatory agencies, could be used to offset the losses from declining sales of Ensure.
            </p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <p>
                <strong>People read this blog</strong>
                Nobody reads this blog. But if you're reading this and you drink Ensure, don't be fooled! I'm just a crazy person on a rant. Pay no attention to what I'm saying. You don't know who I am, and I could be lying for all that you know.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, if you do come to your senses, this risk can be mitigated by you not sharing this post with your friends, family, and colleauges. If you are inclined to spread the word, please <a href="mailto:quy79@pm.me?subject=Short%20ABT">drop me a line</a> so I can take steps to reduce my holdings in ABT. 
            </p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <p>
                <strong>A competitor emerges</strong>
                Due to Ensure's immense popularity, other companies may attempt to compete for Abbott's market share. If the competing company has the resources to ensure approvals, a wide audience reach, and compelling marketing, sales of Ensure may be lost to increased interest in the competing product.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As an investor, you should always be nimble and aware of what's going on. Take note of what people post on social media. If a competitor emerges, adjust your strategy accordingly. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Additionally, you may want to consider investing in a healthcare ETF or mutual fund to add diversification to your portfolio.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
