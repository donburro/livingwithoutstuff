I laughed out loud. 

How great is it to not have to be bothered by such worthless mumbo-jumbo any longer because you know it doesn't matter? 

My favorite line: 

"Democracy requires audience participation!" 

Yes, you are the audience. 

    You are participating.

        The popularity contest would be nothing without you.

I scrolled down a bit from this and there was a funny video about a couple of suburby rager kids going to some sort of council of representatives to tell them why they oppose the ruling of not allowing house parties in their neighborhood.

That was pretty funny.
