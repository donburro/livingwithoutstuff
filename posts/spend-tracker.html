            I've been meaning to get this up here for a while. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/presidential-proclamation-national-preparedness-month-2018/">National Preparedness Month</a> has come and gone and I have a month's worth of transactions to categorize. 
        </p>

        <div class="caption">

        <p>
            I started fresh on a new budget at the beginning of the month, adding only notes to the items to jog my memory for proper categorization. I want to keep my budget as simple as possible, so I'll be categorizing transactions into only three groups,
        </p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>capital expenses</li>
            <li>necessary operational expenses, and</li>
            <li>discretionary operation expenses,</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>
            which, together, will capture any type of expense. Whether it be a one-time furniture purchase, a once-in a while taxi ride, or the monthly rent expense, it'll fit into one of those categories. Notes will assist me if I want to do further investigation and analysis later down the line.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Here's what my budget looks like:
        </p>
        
        <div class="caption">
            <img src="images/spend-tracker/budget-view.png">
            Simple is sexy
        </div>
        
        <p> 
            Whew. I've got <strong>$6,352.59</strong> worth of expenses to categorize. It's sort of a scary number, because for the past more than two years, I've averaged less than $1500/month. I just moved into a new apartment though, so I'm guessing that a sizable portion of that will be non reoccurring one-time capital expenses.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I will keep another category for things that I want to allocate money towards, like monthly investment amounts or buying a course. I will use the <strong>Investments</strong> category for this for now.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I will not track cashback or expenses incurred by me on behalf of my employer.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Definitions</h2>
        
        <p>
            Before we begin, let's define the categories a bit further to help in categorization.
        </p>
        
        <ul class="texty-list">
            
            <li><strong>CapEx</strong><br>
                One time or infrequent expenses. 
            </li>
            
            <li><strong>Necessary OpEx</strong><br>
                Repeating expenses that are absolutely necessary to <s>my survival</s> maintaining a decent standard of living. On top of things that are necessary to survival (food, water) are things that help me maintain a certain standard of living (shelter, personal hygiene products).
            </li>
            
            <li><strong>Discretionary OpEx</strong><br>
                What does not fall into necessary OpEx category. Repeating expenses that can be avoided if money became an issue. Things I could live without if I lost all ability to make money and had to really turn the dial down on my expenses.
            </li>
        
        </ul>
        
        <p>
            The purpose of breaking up OpEx into two categories is to determine the minimum amount I should keep in my emergency fund: Twelve months of Necessary OpEx. 
        </p>
        
        <h2>Go</h2>
        
        <p>
            First expense of the month:
        </p>
        
        <div class="caption">
            <img src="images/spend-tracker/rent-expense.png">
        </div>
        
        <p>
            You could say I got pretty lucky to find a nice place in San Francisco for such a good rate. I was allocating $1500 for rent, then convinced myself that I would probably need to up that to $1800 for a decent place, then stumbled across something that worked out very well.
        </p>
        
        <li>Rent: Necessary OpEx </li>

        <p>
            Next up are two food expenses:
        </p>
        
        <div class="caption">

        <p>
            While eating food is necessary, dining out is not. 
        </p>
        
        <li>Groceries: Necessary OpEx </li>
        <li>Restaurants: Discretionary OpEx</li>

            I topped up my mom's car after having borrowed it for a while. If I owned the car, I would consider this discretionary OpEx, but this is not something that will repeat at set intervals.

            Wow, it's been a year since I started LWS.

            This should really be classified as a business expense. Granted, I have no business income, so it won't really make much of a difference, but it seems like now is as good a time as any to start tracking this. I'll put it in a catch-all just in case my CPA can do something cool with it.
        </p>

            Transportation is necessary, and there are many options available, including walking, biking, driving, public transit, and taxi.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            If my bike was stolen, it's too far to walk, and I don't have a car, my options are taxi or public transit. One of them must be discretionary.
        </p>
        
        <li>Taxi: Discretionary OpEx</li>
        <li>Public transit: Necessary OpEx</li>
        
        <p>
            You could, however, make the argument that public transit is also discretionary, since you <em>can</em> walk, but I'm not going to go that far.
        </p>

            Ah, this one is tricky:
        </p>
        
        <div class="caption">
            <img src="images/spend-tracker/silvergrogg.png">
        </div>
        
        <p>
            I bought medicinal ingredients (bourbon and lime) because I was starting to feel a little sick. Where does this fall?
        </p>
        
        <p>
            It's not strictly a one-time expense because when I run out of bourbon or silver, I will buy more. It is a product whose consumption helps fend off sickness, but it is not absolutely necessary. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            If my life depended on it, I <em>would be able</em> to avoid this expense, but I <em>would not</em> because the benefit it provides far outweighs the upfront cost. I don't want my baseline to be that stringent:
        </p>
        
        <li>Sickness prevention: Necessary OpEx</li>
        
        <hr>
        
        <p>
            Getting stronger:

            <img src="images/spend-tracker/strength-training.png">
        </div>
        
        <p>
            In my mind, definitely necessary. In my budget, the expense is optional.
        </p>
        
        <li>Gym membership/personal training: Discretionary OpEx</li>

            Oh yea. Definitely necessary. You wouldn't want to talk to me otherwise.
