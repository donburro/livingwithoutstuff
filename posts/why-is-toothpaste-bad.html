        What did I find that convinced me to stop using toothpaste? Perhaps more importantly, what made me continue to be bullish on toothpaste sales, even though I stopped. Wasn't I afraid that others would find out the same thing and also stop using toothpaste?

        Well, I don't remember what exactly happened. But I'm sure we can create a fresh sensation. 

        Let's start by going to the Colgate website: https://www.colgate.com

        Click on Oral Care Center --> Cavities

        No products? Wait, Too Much Drilling? Not All Early Tooth Decay Needs a Filling? Interesting...: https://www.colgate.com/en-us/oral-health/conditions/cavities/too-much-drilling-not-all-early-tooth-decay-needs-a-filling

        Ah, there's a product: https://www.colgate.com/en-us/products/toothpaste/ct-clean-mint

        Let's check out the ingredients: https://smartlabel.labelinsight.com/product/4051754/other

        It's easy to look up an MSDS: http://www.sciencelab.com/msds.php?msdsId=9927595

        Where to buy? We can get it on Amazon. I wonder what the reviews say: https://www.amazon.com/Colgate-Total-Clean-Mint-Toothpaste/product-reviews/B000RK9SFQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_hist_1?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&reviewerType=all_reviews#reviews-filter-bar

        I found a link to a NYT article: https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/07/well/live/why-your-toothpaste-has-triclosan.html?register=email&auth=register-email

        You can go on. Hopefully this answers both questions of why I stopped using toothpaste, but also am not too afraid of Colgate losing the 44% total market share of the oral hygiene market that they have.
