    <h2>New Budget Setup</h2>
    
    <div class="post">
        
        <p>
            I've been meaning to get this up here for a while. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/presidential-proclamation-national-preparedness-month-2018/">National Preparedness Month</a> has come and gone which means I have a month's worth of transactions to categorize. 
        </p>

        <div class="caption">
            <img src="images/09-sep-expense/sep-pending.png">
        </div>

        <p>
            I started fresh on a new budget at the beginning of the month, adding only notes to the items to jog my memory for proper categorization. I want to keep my budget as simple as possible, so I'll be categorizing transactions into only three groups,
        </p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>capital expenditures</li>
            <li>necessary operational expenses, and</li>
            <li>discretionary operation expenses,</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>
            which, together, will capture any type of expense. Whether it be a one-time furniture purchase, a once-in a while taxi ride, or the monthly rent expense, it'll fit into one of those categories. Notes will assist me if I want to do further investigation and analysis later down the line.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Here's what my budget looks like:
        </p>
        
        <div class="caption">
            <img src="images/09-sep-expense/budget-view.png">
            Simple is sex
        </div>
        
        <p> 
            Whew. I've got <strong>$6&nbsp;352.59</strong> worth of expenses to categorize. It's sort of a scary number, because for the past more than two years, I've averaged less than $1&nbsp;500/month. I just moved into a new apartment though, so I'm guessing that a sizable portion of that will be non reoccurring one-time capital expenditures.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I will keep another category for things I want to allocate money, like monthly investment amounts or buying a course. I will use the <strong>Investments</strong> category for this.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I will not track cashback or reimbursable expenses incurred by me on behalf of my employer.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Definitions</h3>
        
        <p>
            Before we begin, let's define the categories a bit further to help in categorization.
        </p>
        
        <ul class="texty-list">
            
            <li><strong>CapEx</strong><br>
                <em>"money a company spends to buy, maintain, or improve its fixed assets, such as buildings, vehicles, equipment, or land."</em> - Wikibebia. This definition is pretty good and can apply to my personal expenses.
            </li>
            
            <li><strong>Necessary OpEx</strong><br>
                Repeating expenses that are an essential part of my life. On top of the things that I need to survive (food, water), things that I would not want to go without fall into this category (personal hygiene products, pens)
            </li>
            
            <li><strong>Discretionary OpEx</strong><br>
                Repeating expenses that do not fall into necessary OpEx category. These can be avoided if money became an issue because I could live without them if I lost all ability to make money.
            </li>
        
        </ul>
        
        <p>
            The purpose of breaking up OpEx into two categories is to determine the minimum amount I should keep in my emergency fund. I'm aiming for twelve months of Necessary OpEx. 
        </p>
        
        <h3>Go</h3>
        
        <p>
            First expense of the month:
        </p>
        
        <div class="caption">
            <img src="images/09-sep-expense/rent-expense.png">
        </div>
        
        <p>
            You could say I got pretty lucky to find a nice place in San Francisco for such a good rate. I was allocating $1500 for rent, then convinced myself that I would probably need to up that to $1800 for a decent place, then stumbled across something that worked out very well.
        </p>
        
        <li>Rent: Necessary OpEx </li>
        
        <hr>
        
        <p>
            Next up are two food expenses:
        </p>
        
        <div class="caption">
            <img src="images/09-sep-expense/food-expenses.png">
        </div>
        
        <p>
            While eating food is necessary, dining out is not. 
        </p>
        
        <li>Groceries: Necessary OpEx </li>
        <li>Restaurants: Discretionary OpEx</li>
        
        <hr>
        
        <div class="caption">

        </div>
        
        <p>
            I topped up my mom's car after having borrowed it for a while. If I owned the car, I would consider this discretionary OpEx, but this is not something that will repeat consistently. 
        </p>
        
        <li>Topping up someone else's car: CapEx</li>
        
        <p>
            A bit broader:    
        </p>
        
        <li>Gifts: CapEx</li>

            Wow, it's been a whole year of LWS. I remember the epiphany of the name, then going to Google Domains to check if it was available in the wee hours of the morning. I thought, <em>"man, there's so much stuff that people say that you need that you can live without. I  want to make a site that helps people un-learn the lies they have been told."</em> 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            This post is about how you don't need a bunch of categories in your budget.
        </p>
        
        <div class="caption">

        <p>
            This should really be classified as a business expense. Granted, I have no business income, so it won't really make much of a difference, but it seems like now is as good a time as any to start tracking this. I'll put it in a catch-all just in case my CPA can do something cool with it.
        </p>
        
        <li>Domain renewal: Business Expenses (New category)</li>

        <div class="caption">

        <p>
            Transportation is necessary. There are many options available, including walking, biking, driving, public transit, and taxi.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            If my bike was stolen, it's too far to walk, and I don't have a car, my options are taxi, public transit, or hitchhike. One of them is free, and one of the other two must be discretionary.
        </p>
        
        <li>Taxi: Discretionary OpEx</li>
        <li>Public transit: Necessary OpEx</li>
        
        <p>
            You could, however, make the argument that public transit is also discretionary, since you <em>can</em> walk, but I'm not going to go that far.

            Ah, this one is tricky:
        </p>
        
        <div class="caption">
            <img src="images/09-sep-expense/silvergrogg.png">
        </div>
        
        <p>
            I bought medicinal ingredients (bourbon and lime) because I was starting to feel a little sick. Where does this fall?
        </p>
        
        <p>
            It's not strictly a one-time expense because when I run out of bourbon or silver, I will buy more. It is a product whose consumption helps fend off sickness, but it is not absolutely necessary. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            If my life depended on it, I <em>would be able</em> to avoid this expense, but I <em>would not</em> because the benefit it provides far outweighs the upfront cost. 
        </p>

            Getting stronger:
        </p>
        
        <div class="caption">
            <img src="images/09-sep-expense/strength-training.png">
        </div>
        
        <p>
            In my mind, definitely necessary. In my budget, the expense is optional.
        </p>
        
        <li>Gym membership/personal training: Discretionary OpEx</li>
        
        <hr>
        
        <div class="caption">
            <img src="images/09-sep-expense/teeth-hygiene.png">
        </div>
        
        <p>
            Oh yea. Definitely necessary. You wouldn't want to talk to me otherwise.
        </p>
        
        <li>Personal hygiene: Necessary OpEx</li>
        
        <hr>
        
        <p>
            Hmmm.</p>
        
        <div class="caption">
            <img src="images/09-sep-expense/going-out.PNG">
        </div>
        
        <p>
            Going out used to happen much more frequently than it does today. Three years ago, it would almost be a weekendly thing, now it happens once every few months, <em>maybe</em>. There is no improvement made to a fixed asset or physical good purchased attained from going out, so it won't be CapEx.

            Parking.
        </p>
        
        <div class="caption">
            <img src="images/09-sep-expense/parking.PNG">
        </div>
        
        <p>
            A necessary expense if you have a car. Having a car is optional in my case. 
        </p>
        
        <li>Parking: Discretionary OpEx</li>
        
        <hr>
        
        <p>
            Last one I'll show:
        </p>
        
        <div class="caption">
            <img src="images/09-sep-expense/travel.PNG">
        </div>
        
        <p>
            What is travel? It's not exactly a capital expense for the same reason going out isn't. It's not <em>necessary</em> for me to travel to LA, so I suppose the power of simplicity leaves only one option.
        </p>
        
        <li>Travel: Discretionary OpEx</li>
        
    </div>
