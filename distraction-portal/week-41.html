            Some loud mouthed people don't want to take tests in class anymore, but want to take a take-home essay. Good idea maybe, but not sure that getting up and yelling on the day of the test is the right way to request that.

        Man, I had really different expectations for what she was going to talk about, but I guess they were too high.

        Her last age milestone, 25, was one that I just passed, and I've been thinking a lot about what it will be like to turn 30, 40, or even 50. Turns out that Jessica and I think about it quite differently.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Things that change when you go from 25 to 30, according to Jessica:
    </p>
    
    <ul class="texty-list">
        <li><strong>Priorities, friendships, everything</strong>
            <br>
            Yes
        </li>
        
        <li><strong>Drinking changes</strong>
            <br>
            You get hungover multiple days and get <em>the scaries</em>, which is crippling anxiety and depression after you have fun at the bar or club.
        </li>
        
        <li><strong>Your face</strong>
            <br>
            Her skin care routine consists of putting on a lot of overpriced skin care products that won't save you.
        </li>
        
        <li><strong>Your body</strong>
            <br>
            Metabolism slows down and you have to watch what you eat because it's <s>easier to get fat</s> harder to keep  off the weight. Something negative also happens with fake titties. Not sure what, she only lamented it without specifying.
        </li>
        
        <li><strong>Going out</strong>
            <br>
            It's hard to have a social life, make amazing connections, have the time of your life, and get picked up because all that stuff happens after bedtime. Sounds like she needs to adopt something like a <a href="http://livingwithoutstuff.com/posts/core-hours-life.html">core hours policy</a>. Shots give three day hangovers.
        </li>
        
        <li><strong>Dating</strong>
            <br>
            The immature guys that you knew in your 20s have <s>grown up to be immature men</s> haven't grown up at all and still are emotional beta males. Your tolerance for bullshit goes to nothing. If a guy isn't following exactly the script you have in your head for him, you cut him off early and save yourself time.
        </li>
        
        <li><strong>You feel good</strong>
            <br>
            At least you're not as stupid as you were when you were 21. And, you need more coffee.
        </li>

        Man, that was a great video. I think I'm gonna start watching more like this. YouTube will put them in my recommended feed. Isn't YouTube great?
