            Starting late this week. It's not that I haven't been watching videos, I just haven't been posting them here. I <em>have</em> been adding them to a playlist, so not all is lost.

            Never misunderestimate someone just because you think he's an idiot. <em>You</em> may be the idiot for believing that he's an idiot. Because while you're spending all that time thinking he's an idiot, he's quietly executing on his plan to accomplish his mission.

        <p>
            Now, who's the idiot?

            Interesting video up next lookin at the state of society in South Korea.

            If you look closely, you can draw some parallels to the way we're going: Intense competition for higher education and top jobs; popularization of bodily mutilation (sex change, plastic surgery included); increased rate of suicide amongst young adults and teens - mainly boys; extreme disconnection from nature.

            It's not to say that you can't have a great life in a fallen society, though. If it's your nature to do what's right, regardless of what society says, you can still do it, but you will have a much harder time. I wonder what will happen there.
