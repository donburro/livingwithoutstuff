    <h2>Chair research</h2>
    
    <div class="video-list">
        
        <p>
            Looking for some desk chairs. Found out pretty quickly that if you search for 'office chair reviews' you get some crappy how-to videos like this that don't help at all.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            (Don't watch the whole video... unless you want to waste the precious time)
        </p>
        
        <div class="video-container video-container-16x9">
            <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kv57jQoTYsQ" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        </div>
        
        <p>
            And then I look for gaming chairs and get this instead:
        </p>
        
        <div class="video-container video-container-16x9">
            <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Sb4dAul6bmM" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        </div>
        
        <p>
            Chairs listed in this video:
        </p>
        
        <ol class="texty-list">
            <li><strong>Deerhunter gaming chair</strong><br>
                Nothing special, nothing to write home about. You can feel the frame when you squeeze the chair. That's all he has to say about this one.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                <strong>OPseat Master series</strong><br>
                Very similar to the Deerhunter, it might be made in the same factory or use the same parts, but it has better padding. It's one of his favorite for price/performance due to color options and comfort.
            </li>
            
            <li><strong>OPseat Grandmaster series</strong><br>
                Wider seat base and for taller people than the Master Series. The chair has a breathable mesh (don't spill on it).
            </li>
            
            <li><strong>Tesoro Zone Balance</strong><br>
                Classy aesthetics. The chair has thicker padding than the above, so it gives a lot of comfort. Also one of the very best price/performance chair at $229.
            </li>
            
            <li><strong>Anda Seat</strong><br>
                His least favorite because it's hard as a rock. You may not want to be stuck between this and a hard place. Pass on it unless you sleep on the floor or a really hard mattress.
            </li>
            
            <li><strong>Secret Lab Omega 2018</strong><br>
                A great reason why you should not buy the Anda Seat. It's as good as it gets for its price point. Lumbad pillow made of memory foam. Suede head pillow. PU leather. Padding incredible. Ergonomics great. The seat hugs you. The color options are pretty good. Brainbean uses this as his daily driver, and would recommend it over all chairs except one.
            </li>
            
            <li><strong>Noblechairs Epic Series</strong><br>
                Everything is top notch. Nice suede side accents. Pillows feel like suede too. It takes a while to break in as the padding comes hard out of the box. He thinks it's slightly less comfortable than the Secret Labs chair.
            </li>
            
            <li><strong>LF Gaming Stealth Edition</strong><br>
                As premium an experience you can get with a gaming chair. Thermoguard foam that pulls heat away from your body. Nice quality, soft, durable, and easy-to-clean fabric. High quality memory foam that covers the entire chair, including the armrests. Built in head pillow and lumbar cushions. I just wonder why, if this chair is the best, he uses the Secret Labs chair as his daily driver.
            </li>
            
        </ol>
        
        <p>
            If you want to save money, Brainbean suggests to get the OPseat Master Series because general comfort is <em>"not bad"</em>, although he would go with the Tesoro Zone Balance.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            If you want to save less money, go with the Secret Labs over the Noblechairs chair because it takes less time to break in, and you'll get comfortable in it quicker
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Overall, the Secret Labs Omega 2018 is the best chair that he's used this year.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            And then there are things to consider before buying a gaming chair:
        </p>
        
        <div class="video-container video-container-16x9">
            <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/G7MTlS4aJTo" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        </div>
        
        <p>
            So as you can see, the raaaabbit hole goes deep with chairs as well.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The seven things to think about are:
        </p>
        
        <ol class="texty-list">
            <li>
                <strong>The biggest selling point of gaming chairs are their design.</strong>
                <br>
                The crappy-looking office chairs 
            </li>
            
            <li>
                <strong>Height and weight are the most important considerations</strong>
                <br>
                Don't get one that's outside of your range. Check the spec sheet.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                <strong>A lot of gaming chairs sold by different companies are made by the same manufacturer</strong>
                <br>
                The difference is the level of support (care) you'll get. You'll have a better experience if you need to interact with a more reputable company.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                <strong>Consider the adjustment features</strong>
                <br>
                Ok
            </li>
            
            <li>
                <strong>The lumbar support pillows can be hit or miss</strong>
                <br>
                Sometimes the pillow just falls down if the pillow isn't affixed to the chair. There are some that the lumbar support is built into the chair. 
            </li>
            
            <li>
                <strong>It's not always possible to test a chair before purchase</strong>    
                <br>
                It's just like buying anything online. Like, exactly the same. You gotta look at the pictures and watch other people sitting on it on YouTube to make your decision.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                <strong>Give your new chair some time before you hate it</strong>
                <br>
                Ok, so if you go from sitting shittily to sitting properly, your body is going to ache for a while, and the chair has nothing to do with your past mistakes. A good way to know what the right posture is is to take note of how you sit while you are pooping.
            </li>
            
        </ol>
        
        <p>
            Basically, you'll only know whether the chair is right for you after having sat in it for a while.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Next we have a babe telling us how to set up an ergonomic workstation:
        </p>
        
        <div class="video-container video-container-16x9">
            <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z3uBJdW6Akk" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        </div>
        
        <p>
            It did not have much to do with the chair, but it was helpful to know approximately where things should be in relation to other things.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The three things you should consider with the chair:
        </p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Good lumbar support</li>
            <li>There should be a little space between the edge of your seat and the back of your knees</li>
            <li>Make sure your feet don't dangle. But if they do, don't adjust the height of your chair.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>
            Another video of a guy telling us all the things (five things, three of which we already know) we are doing wrong sitting at our desks was equally helpful, because knowing <em>what not to do</em> is just as helpful as knowing <em>what to do</em>. Often, you need to know both to be able to do something properly.
        </p>
        
        <div class="video-container video-container-16x9">
            <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ree1CWifQTg" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        </div>
        
        <p> 
            Here's what David says to not do:
        </p>
        
        <ol class="texty-list">
            <li><strong>Don't sit up perfectly straight</strong><br>
                It's temping to do because of the script we have in our heads that a straight back is "ergonomic," but it puts a lot of unnecessary straing on your spine. So, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T20aIntlGVo&t=1m10s">lean back</a>.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Don't set your chair height for your feet</strong><br> 
                Set it for your keyboard and mouse. These peripherals should be a few inches above your legs. If your table is non-adjustable and too high like mine, that means you should be using an under-the-desk keyboard tray. If your feet are still hanging, get a thing to rest them on.
            </li>
            
            <li><strong>Don't use desks with built-in drawers</strong><br>
                How else would you keep your peripherals just a few inches above your legs? </li>
            
            <li><strong>Don't use wrist rests</strong><br>
                The pressure that it puts on your wrists restricts blood flow. 
            </li>
            
            <li><strong>Standing is not better than sitting</strong><br>
                Don't be fooled by those <em>"ergonomic specialists"</em> that come by your desk at your corporate job who tell you that working your corporate job won't suck the soul out of you if you just get a standing desk.

            <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Dh9wyy0S3dg" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        </div>
            </li>
            
        </ol>

        <p>
            The problem with racing/gaming chairs:
        </p>
        
        
        <div class="video-container video-container-16x9">
            <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FeAmL9UFAi4" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        </div>
    
        <p>
            Well, I gotta say, I do really like how cool gaming chairs look, and so far have been basing my desire to buy one based on the look. It's not like I have gone out and sat on a bunch of (any) chairs to get a feel for them.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The generalized problems:
        </p>
        
        <ul class="texty-list">
            <li><strong>Lack of adjustments</strong><br>
                Most racing/gaming chairs don't have seat pan depth adjustment or have good options for lumbar support. Although this is also a problem with other chairs... so... maybe this is not <em>as big a problem</em>.
            </li>
            
            <li>The <strong>bucket seat design</strong> 
                makes it awkward to cross your legs on the seat. 
            </li>
            
            <li><strong>The price</strong> 
                reflects that you're paying for a "premium gaming" product that moreso <em>looks</em> better than <em>actually is</em> better than another chair available at the same price.
            </li>
        </ul>
    
        <hr>
        
        <p>
            So far, there is one chairs that has caught my attention enough to investigate further, and that's the <a target="_blank" href="https://secretlab.co/products/titan?view=abtest">Secret Lab TITAN</a> chair, and it's probably because BrainBean spoke so highly of Secret Labs chairs it in his review of eight different chairs.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            He <em>was</em> talking about the Secret Labs Omega series, the specifications for the Omega specified that it was for people shorter than myself. The Titan is for taller people.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            So here's a guy that got the Titan and unboxed it.
        </p>
        
        <div class="video-container video-container-16x9">
            <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-OLJHWtTlZc" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        </div>
        
        <p>
            Then he sat in it for a week, 7-8 hours a day, and did this review. You can tell because he is wearing different clothes.
        </p>
        
        <div class="video-container video-container-16x9">
            <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bsvkuhb2FKk?start=56" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        </div>
        
        
        <p>
            What I appreciate about his review is that he tells you upfront about the chair he was sitting in before so that you can adjust your expectations accordingly. If he had been sitting in a crappy chair, the feeling of sitting in a $400 chair would have been overwhelmingly positive and the review would reflect that. On the other hand, if he was coming from a TOTL (top-of-the-line) chair, this one would not be as great.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The chair that he was sitting in prior to the Titan was <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seating-Professional-AirGrid-Adjustable-Managers/dp/B000PWGZOI/ref=asc_df_B000PWGZOI/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=167131160102&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=13223200224691084744&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9057119&hvtargid=pla-272244777507&psc=1" target="_blank">this one</a>. Comparatively, the Titan is a much better sitting experience.
        </p>
        
        <p> 
            Things that he likes about the Titan:
        </p>
        
        <ul class="texty-list">
            <li><strong>Comfort</strong> - the chair is firm, but it is a supportive firm rather than an uncomfortable firm. 
            </li>
            
            <li><strong>Adjustable lumbar support</strong> - He's mainly kept the lumbar support setting at full resistance, but did adjust it down when his body got a little stiff from sitting in an unfamiliar (better) position.
            </li>
            
            <li><strong>Reclining seat</strong> - it's pretty comfortable, especially if you want to lay back a bit when watching something or doing repetitive tasks. Recommended that you get something to rest your feet on while reclining. The addition of the <strong>pillow</strong> works well to give your head something to rest upon.
            </li>

        </ul>
        
        <p>
            Things that he doesn't like:
        </p>
        
        <ul class="texty-list">
            <li><strong>The bucket seat</strong> because he likes to sit legs wide. The raised edges get in the way of the hamstring location. Supposedly, it is better to sit with your legs closer together, so this may be a blessing in disguise to correct a negative sitting habit.
            </li>
            
            <li>The <strong>lack of design choices and color schemes</strong> - He'd like to see an all-black version of the chair. Idk.
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        
        <p>
            Since a week isn't a very long time to have been sitting in a chair, and I plan on sitting in the chair I get for a much longer time, I wanted to see if I could find someone who has done a review after a longer period of time.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I found Crue Steele who's been (supposedly) sitting in the chair for over  a year. He meant to do a one-week review, but I think the one-year review is just fine.
