    <h2>Chair research</h2>
    
    <div class="video-list">
        
        <p>
            Looking for some desk chairs. Found out pretty quickly that if you search for 'office chair reviews' you get some addy crap like this that doesn't help at all:
        </p>
        
        <p>
            (Don't watch the whole video... unless you want to waste the precious time)
        </p>
        
        <div class="video-container video-container-16x9">
            <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kv57jQoTYsQ" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        </div>
        
        <p>
            Compare that to this one I found when looking for a gaming chair instead:
        </p>
        
        <div class="video-container video-container-16x9">
            <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Sb4dAul6bmM" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        </div>
        
        <p>
            And then there are things to consider before buying a gaming chair:
        </p>
        
        <div class="video-container video-container-16x9">
            <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/G7MTlS4aJTo" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        </div>
        
        <p>
            So as you can see, the raaaabbit hole goes deep with chairs as well.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The seven things to think about are:
        </p>
        
        <ol class="texty-list">
            <li>
                <strong>The biggest selling point of gaming chairs are their design.</strong>
                <br>
                The crappy-looking office chairs 
            </li>
            
            <li>
                <strong>Height and weight are the most important considerations</strong>
                <br>
                Don't get one that's outside of your range. Check the spec sheet.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                <strong>A lot of gaming chairs sold by different companies are made by the same manufacturer</strong>
                <br>
                The difference is the level of support (care) you'll get. You'll have a better experience if you need to interact with a more reputable company.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                <strong>Consider the adjustment features</strong>
                <br>
                Ok
            </li>
            
            <li>
                <strong>The lumbar support pillows can be hit or miss</strong>
                <br>
                Sometimes the pillow just falls down if the pillow isn't affixed to the chair. There are some that the lumbar support is built into the chair. 
            </li>
            
            <li>
                <strong>It's not always possible to test a chair before purchase</strong>    
                <br>
                It's just like buying anything online. Like, exactly the same. You gotta look at the pictures and watch other people sitting on it on YouTube to make your decision.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                <strong>Give your new chair some time before you hate it</strong>
                <br>
                Ok, so if you go from sitting shittily to sitting properly, your body is going to ache for a while, and the chair has nothing to do with your past mistakes. A good way to know what the right posture is is to take note of how you sit while you are pooping.
            </li>
            
        </ol>
        
        <p>
            Basically, you'll only know whether the chair is right for you after having sat in it for a while.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Next we have a babe telling us how to set up an ergonomic workstation:
        </p>
        
        <div class="video-container video-container-16x9">
            <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z3uBJdW6Akk" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        </div>
        
        <p>
            It did not have much to do with the chair, but it was helpful to know approximately where things should be in relation to other things.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Another video of a guy telling us all the things (five things) we are doing wrong sitting at our desks was equally helpful, but not because of the gender of the person:
        </p>
        
        <div class="video-container video-container-16x9">
            <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ree1CWifQTg" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        </div>
        
        <p>
            Knowing what not to do is just as helpful as knowing what to do. In fact, you need to know both to be able to do something properly. Here's what the guy says to not do:
        </p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Don't sit up perfectly straight</li>
            <li>Don't set your chair height for your feet. Set it for your keyboard and mouse.</li>
            <li>Don't use desks with built-in drawers. Darn, this is the type of desk I have. </li>
            <li>Don't use wrist rests</li>
            <li>Standing is not better than sitting. Yes!</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>
            Standing while working is such a popular fad these days that people get all kinds of contraptions to be able to stand up while working, just like the factory workers had to do. Turns out that staying stationary for long periods of time is what's bad for you. Who would have thought? Especially after all of the <em>evaluations with ergonomic specialists</em>.
