        <p>
            Wow, that's so easy, let me try it. Tomorrow I'll just say "Okay" all day to anyone that says anything to me.

            No Don, you're crazy. It's so far-fetched, far-right, alt-right, xenophobic, sexist ideas that hold no the basis in the reality and you'r creazy for belevening it. You need to watch more MSNBCNNBBC news at seven.

            When you are tired, you are more susceptible to things getting past your mental filter. So in the evening, when most people are tired after work is the best time to have the news shows because people have a harder time distinguishing what is bullshit.

            If I was a TV entertainment executive, I would charge a premium to have the news aired in the evening.

            I'm currently eating a <a href="http://livingwithoutstuff/food/burgermeal.html">Burger Meal</a> and am about to click on a bunch of videos on my home page that YouTube genius algorithm has recommended for me.

            These reporters don't ask very interesting questions, and they're the same ones that have been asked in other press conferences.

            No wonder the mainstream media sucks. It's still <a href="http://livingwithoutstuff.com/posts/redpilled.html">fun to observe</a> though.

            The show <em>Black Mirror</em> isn't about commentary of where humanity is heading with technology. It's about <strong>where we already are</strong>. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            It's one of the reasons I love the show so much. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Don't be mislead by how advanced the technology is or that we don't have whatever features yet. The technology is advanced in the show so that it's out of the way. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            It's not the technology's fault that all of the terrible things are happening in the show, it's our's.

            The whole idea of this sort of project and communities is just to spread the word that hey, there is a project where you can really come, and if you want to really learn, then you can learn. We just want to make sure that there is people that is making a career here, they are overcoming the ... salaries ... all different kinds of problems in the industry.

            What they're saying is that girls are too dumb to figure out that they can learn about opportunities on their own.

                Q is real, but not what its followers think.  I spent a career in military intelligence.  This Q phenomenon is a very well executed psyop directed AT those Trump supporters who should be revolting because he hasn’t locked her up or built a wall.  Q is keeping those supporters pacified with the farce that a massive counter-coups is being fought in the shadows.   
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I often remark that Q is fan fiction meets psychological operation.﻿
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <p>
            This is someting that some of the people around me are saying. Imagine if Q is just a psyop meant to keep people from revolting. If that's the case, it's simply a delay tactic, because once it becomes clear that it wasn't real, then those people will revolt anyway. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            If Q is just a psyop to keep people pacified, a civil war will break out.

            Interesting take on the Georgia Guidestones that <a href="http://livingwithoutstuff.com/posts/future.html">I wrote a poem about</a>.

            She's right. It doesn't matter who built the guidestones or why they built it. They are just stones with words carved into them. The only power they have is that which we give them.

            And here I am, writing about them again, making you aware of their presence. And this will not be the last time you hear about them. You may even go down a rabbit hole trying to connect the dots of the mystery. You'll waste your time on them.
