            This is an interesting recommendation.

            So you're saying all that I have to say is "Okay" and I'll be higher status than the person I'm talking to?
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Wow, that's so easy, let me try it. Tomorrow I'll just say "Okay" all day to anyone that says anything to me.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Okay.
        </p>

            Oh, did you know that Fa4ceb00k is stalking your every thought and exploiting it to make you buy more things when you're emotionally vulnerable and working with the G000gle to give you the <em>real</em> news when it matters most?

            And that the solution is just to not use the social medias? Isn't that so easy to do?

            No Don, you're crazy. It's so far-fetched, far-right, alt-right, xenophobic, sexist ideas that hold no the basis in the reality and you'r creazy for belevening it. You need to watch more MSNBCNNBBC news at seven.
        </p>

            When you are tired, you are more susceptible to things getting past your mental filter. So in the evening, when most people are tired after work is the best time to have the news shows because people have a harder time distinguishing what is bullshit.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            If I was a TV entertainment executive, I would charge a premium to have the news aired in the evening.
