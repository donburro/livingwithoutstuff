            I've lost friends of 20 years when they found out my support for Trump, I haven't talked to them. It sucks. It's sad. There are some family members I don't talk to anymore. It sucks.

            That's a big problem that we have. We'll lose friends over things that we have no control over. Sometimes your friends will be the ones to leave you, and that sucks, but if they are insistent on it you just have to let them go and move on with your life.

            But imagine how great it would be if we all were able to sit down with each other and have a conversation.
