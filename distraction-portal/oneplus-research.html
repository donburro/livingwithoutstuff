            OnePlus just released the latest version of their top-of-the-line-but-lower-cost smartphone, an even that I was waiting for to upgrade from my Nexus 6, which now sometimes loses the picture I just took.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            So, the question that popped up in my mind is whether I should get the OnePlus 6t or go with last year's version. Research is in order for this decision.
        </p>
        
        <h3>One Plus 6 vs One Plus 6t</h3>

            The first video I found comes from a helpful little man called Matthew Moniz:

            I don't like the fact that they took the headphone jack away from it
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Yea, me neither.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Looks like this is going to be a pretty easy decision.

            <strong>Winner:</strong> One Plus 6
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Headphone jack</li>
            <li>Physical fingerprint reader on the back</li>

        <h3>Oneplus 6 vs Samsung S9</h3>
        
        <p>
            The S9 came up as a contender for my money. It's a pricier phone, but since I'm already doing the research, I thought I'd give it a look as well.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Oh no, it's the Android Police!
        </p>
        
        <div class="video-container video-container-16x9">
            <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QusF_EjD2h8" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        </div>
        
        <p>
            Well, it's not over just yet because the S9+ has a headphone jack. Good on Samsung for not being idiots. </p>
        
        <p>
            The S9+ has wireless charging, which the OnePlus 6 does not. But that's okay with me, because I don't care one lick about wireless charging.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Other things that the S9+ has that the OnePlus 6 does not:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>An IP68 rating</li>
            <li>Expandable SD card slot</li>
            <li>Great sounding stereo speakers</li>
            <li>Stunning, notchless, curved OLED display</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
            When I was a wee young lad, I'd love to rip on iPhone users because their phone lacked a SD card slot. I thought I was the coolest person around with a shitty ass Blackberry because I had expandable storage...
        </p>
            
        <p class="quote">
            Nheighhh, well how much storage does your  shitty iPhone have? Oh, only 64GB? I have INFINITE. Hahahaha, suck it loser.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            ... and I'd go around carrying little microSD cards that I'd proceed to forget what stuff was on there, then lose it.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <strong>Great sounding stereo speakers</strong> sounds really great, but not worth the price difference. The sounds emanating from my phone typically travel though headphone wires before reaching my ears. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <strong>A stunning display</strong> you say?
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Meh. Being able to see the words and pictures on the screen is good enough for me. The notch on the OnePlus 6 can be turned off in the settings, too.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            That gives me enough information to make a decision.
        </p>

            <strong>Winner:</strong> OnePlus 6
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Lower price</li>
            <li>95% same specs as the S9+</li>
            <li>Original choice </li>
            <li>Researching this too long is not a good use of time</li>
