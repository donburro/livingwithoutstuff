            I was watching videos about how to do pushups when YouTube's masterful video-recommendation engine worked its wonder.

            I had heard something about the ID requirements changing in 2018, but didnt think much of it.

            Sounds like a pretty crappy deal. You don't <em>have</em> to get the Real ID, but if you don't you won't be able to go into any Federal bulidings or fly - even domestically.

        <p>
            The funniest thing is that one of the things you don't need an ID for is <strong>voting</strong>. You understand why that is? Do you understand what's been happening? Do you see the malevolence behind that?

            This next video caught my attention because I made a prediction for <a href="http://livingwithoutstuff.com/posts/recession-prediction.html">when the next recession would hit</a>. My prediction might be wrong, and this guy explains why quite clearly:

            A recession is a tool used to accomplish massive wealth transfer, but only if the right monetary policy gets implemented. Because POTUS will not play (((their))) cards, and there are rumors about a takeover of the Federal Reserve, having a recession under Trump's reign will not be effective.

            I could be wrong, and Jonathan might be wrong, but it makes a lot of sense to me. If that's the case, the market is a good place to be right now.
